<STORY>你們遭到伏擊了！
You are ambushed!

一群手持武器、臉上鬍子拉碴的暴徒擋住了你們的路，笑容非常邪惡。他們看起來無所畏懼。從他們自信的姿態和瞥向路邊的眼神，你懷疑他們可能還埋伏了些人手。他們中一人上前說道：
A group of thugs stands in your way, bearing weapons and vile grins on their unshaven faces. They look determined and unafraid. From their confident stance, and sideways glances, you suspect they may have friends hiding nearby. One of them steps forwards and speaks:

「要錢還是要命！我們只要一些金屬和幾把武器，並不貪婪。我們可以輕鬆交涉，或者……嗯，你知道的！我們倒是無所謂採用哪種方法。」
‘Your goods, or your lives! We need some metals and a weapon or two, we’re not too greedy. We can do this the easy way, or… well, you know the rest! We're just fine with either.’
<ANS>「好吧，別衝動。我們會交出貨物，並乖乖離開。沒必要動手。」同意交出貨物。【你將會失去一些道具】
'All right. Let's just keep our heads cool. We will leave you our stuff, and be on our way. No one needs to be hurt here.'  Agree to give away your goods without a fight. [You will lose some items]
<ANS>「我們才不會向你們這些垃圾投降！」不存在放棄資源這個選擇。攻擊！【戰鬥】

The leader of the band gestures to the bandits:

「嗯，你們可能覺得我太軟弱，但我可不喜歡屠殺同胞。我們只拿我們需要的那部分。願斯瓦洛格祝福於我們的慷慨！」
'Eh, you'll call me soft, but I like not havin’ to slaughter some fellow creatures. We'll take what we need and the rest is yours. May Svarog shine on our generous arses!'

強盜們抱怨了一下，但按照首領說的做了。

<PHASE>ID: 4
<STORY>正如你們所擔心的那樣，強盜們似乎不滿意他們的戰利品： 
Just as you feared, the bandits seem dissatisfied with their loot: 

「我們改變主意了，窩囊廢們！我們要拿走所有的東西然後稍微和你們玩玩！」
'We changed our minds softies! We gonna have ourselves all of your stuff and have some fun with ya while we're at it!'

Nevertheless, your best people enter into a hot debate with the would-be attackers.
<ANS>「來吧兄弟們，哦，當然還有姐妹們，我們不都生活在這危機四伏的世界上嗎？共同掙扎，直面人類的命運……」【交涉】
'C’mon men, oh and women of course, we are all in this perilous world together right? Common struggles, fate of mankind…'  [Social]

'You've got a pretty face and sweet talkin’ tongue on you, so why not try and use it!'

其中一個強盜大笑不止。
Laughs one of the men.

其他強盜看上去有點困惑，但你引起了他們隊長的注意。隊長似乎有了興趣，但這時你意識到，你講的話將關乎你的金錢，所以要說……
The other bandits look a bit confused, but you seem to have captured the attention of their leader, you feel the Captain is interested, but you do realise at this point, that you’d better put your mouth where the money is, so to say…
<ANS>沒辦法。交出貨物然後離開。【失去資源】
No way. Giv’em the goods and be off. [Lose resources]
<ANS>「哦，你好，隊長。你的'寶劍'無疑是最雄偉的！」繼續調情以避免交出貨物。
‘Well, hello there Captain, your sword is certainly the biggest!’ Continue flirting to try and avoid ‘giving in’.
<ANS>好吧好吧，反正村莊裡沒什麼可掠奪的……（和隊長單獨前往偏僻處）
Well alright then, the pickings are slim at the village anyway… (Go to the side with the Captain)

<PHASE>ID: 9
<STORY>呃，你試圖用甜言蜜語征服強盜隊長，但他並不買賬。
Well, you tried to sweet talk it with the bandit boss, but he wasn't buying it.

His way of things is simple, you either give them the goods or give them your ‘special goods’, no middle ground.
<ANS>放棄資源。【失去資源】
Give up the resources. [Lose resources]

Give up 'the goods' and have some one-on-one with the boss. Go to the side and see if you can 'negotiate' more.

<PHASE>ID: 10
<STORY>強盜隊長將你帶到一邊並悄聲說道：
The bandit captain takes you to the side and says in a lowered voice: 

「聽著，我確實很想脫下你的褲子讓你爽一爽，但我也不想做強姦犯。所以，你知道的，我們可以坐在這裡喝一杯，然後我會處理好我的人。或者……如果你想……我敢說你是我見過的最性感的人……」
'Listen, I really do fancy the pants out of you, let's make that clear, but I ain't a rapist or somethin'. So, you know, we can just sit here enjoy a drink and then I'll just play my part back there with my men. Or... you know if you want to... I really do think you're like the sexiest creature I've ever seen...'

威武的強盜首領紅著臉直視著你，等待你的回復。
The imposing bandit leader turns bright red and looks straight into your eyes, waiting for an answer.
<ANS>「好吧，讓我們假裝如他們所想的那樣做過了。我們喝一杯吧，朋友。我不得不說，這是個很好的轉折。」
‘Alright, let’s just pretend we did what they think and have a drink my friend. I must say this is a nice turn of events.’
<ANS>「拜託，你得知道你沒這麼差勁！管他呢，讓我們一起舒服舒服吧！」
‘Well, you aren’t so bad yourself you know! What the hell, let’s have some fun times together!’

<PHASE>ID: 11
<STORY>受真誠的話語影響，你拋棄了疑心，讓自己沉浸於激情。你們一起共度了一小時的良宵，附近等待的兩方人馬絲毫不懷疑這裡發生了什麼。
Swayed by their honest speech, you let go of any doubts and let yourself be taken by the passion of the moment. The two of you spend the next hour together, and the two parties waiting nearby have no doubts about what is going on…

分別的時刻來臨，強盜隊長似乎有些遺憾即將離開你。哎，這很可能是你們最後一次相見。
As the time comes to depart, you see the captain looks rather sad to let you go. Alas, this will likely be your last encounter. 

隊長集齊人馬並且離開，遵守了他的諾言。
The captain collects their people and leaves, true to their word. 

明顯有些強盜不滿這個決定，但是強盜隊長一個犀利的眼神讓他們閉嘴了。
There are clearly some bandits unhappy with the decision, but a sharp glare from their boss quietens any discontent.
<ANS>「等等！為什麼你不跟我們一起，我是說和我，一起回到我的村莊？」
‘Wait! Why don’t you just come with us, I mean with me, back to my village?’
<ANS>和你的同伴一起離開。
Leave with your party.
<ANS>「等等！我想加入你們！」【「愛人」(最高魅力的) 會跟著強盜隊長一起離開村莊！】

強盜們如他所言離開了。儘管可以看出明顯有些人不高興，但他們遵從首領的命令。
The bandits depart, true to their word, although you can see some of them aren't particularly pleased, but they follow their leader regardless.
<ANS>在他們改變主意之前離開！

<STORY>隊長笑道：
The Captain smiles:

「對了！加入我們吧！埋頭耕地，擔驚受怕，村莊的生活有什麼好的？我們強大而自由，在這片大陸上橫行，破除黑暗！和我一起走吧！」
‘Yes! Join me! What’s life in a village, tending crops and fearing every moment? We are strong, we are free, and we roam the lands and fight our way through the Darkness! Come with me!’

你內心感受到了冒險的渴望！隊長偷走了你的心，你決定追隨他，至死不渝！
You feel the urge of the adventure in you! The captain has stolen your heart and so you shall follow them into oblivion and beyond!

你不顧村民們的苦苦哀求離開了。隊長被你果斷的決定所感動，給你們留下些禮物。
You leave, despite the desperate pleas of your fellow villagers. The captain, moved by the emotional parting and your decision, leaves a gift for those you left behind.
<ANS>黯然離開，你們失去了陷入愛河的男孩/女孩……

<PHASE>ID: 14
<STORY>你無法眼睜睜看著他們離去！一股衝動讓你追上了離去的戀人！
You can't bear to see them go! Driven by a flash of passion you run after your lover!

強盜們吃驚的看著你，但顯然聽進了你突然的請求。在漫長的沉默過後，其中一位強盜拍了拍隊長的肩說道：
The bandits look at you surprised, but clearly taken by your sudden plea. There is a long and awkward silence, then one the men puts his hands on the captain's shoulder and speaks:

「你既是出色的隊長，也是優秀的同伴。部分人欠你的情，更多人欠你一條命。但你已經志不在此了，如果你想和那美人雙宿雙飛，我們不會阻止你，而是會歡呼著參加你的婚禮！」
'You've been a good captain to us and swell company. Some of us owe you our skins, most of us owe you more. But your heart ain’t in the game no more capt’n, if you wanna go settle with the pretty thing, we ain’t gonna stop ya’, hell we'll cheer and come to the nuptials!'

隊長點頭致謝，揮手告別他們，然後將你一把擁入懷中。
The captain nods in gratitude, shakes the hands of all the band, and then grabs you in a long and shameless embrace.

隊長加入了你的隊伍，並成為你村莊的一份子！
The Captain joins your party and becomes a part of your village!

You sweet-talked the bandit captain so well, they are absolutely besotted with you. The ruffian kneels down before you and swears their love. As a token of their undying affection, they not only let you and your people go, but also give you a parting gift. 

其他強盜們一臉震驚，但還是跟著隊長離開了。

You spoke of the fall of mankind, you spoke of the camaraderie of fellow beings, of the rebirth of Thea and of common goals. 

強盜們不為所動，於是你開始訴說患病的孩子們，餘生無幾的老奶奶海倫娜，中了黑貓陷阱的不幸的年輕小伙子亨利克。
The bandits were not convinced. So you spoke of sickly children, of the old granny Helena, who is on her last legs and of the unfortunate young Henryk, who fell prey to a Liho’s trick. 

地痞們似乎被你訴說的故事所打動，他們不僅放你們離開，還給可憐的老奶奶留下了一些生活用品。

As you make your way through the hills, you are suddenly jumped by a large, ragged group of crazed people who create a lot of chaos, but you’re not sure what their purpose is!

你現在明白了為什麼拾荒者要抓走女人，因為他們之中並沒有女性。一旁的陷坑中，你發現兩名孕婦蜷縮在一起，旁邊還躺著一位死去的孕婦。
You realise now why the scavengers take their prey, as you see there are no women among the fighters, but instead you see another pit where two pregnant females sit huddled together and another lies dead on the side.

As you make your way through the terrain, your herbalist spots an area where you can harvest some good herbs. 

它們長在空心樹內，但小心，周圍似乎有很多蜘蛛網。
They grow inside a hollowed tree, but beware, there seems to be a lot of spider webs surrounding the place.

「這些蜘蛛網厚得令人毛骨悚然，我們最好快些。」你們中一個人說道。
'These webs look thicker than I like, we best be quick about our business here' - exclaims one of your men.

You already picked some of the herbs, but you notice that there is a larger patch further down the path, however, that area has a sticky white blanket of webs thrown all over it.
<ANS>拿上你們已經得到的東西離開這裡。
Take what you've already got and leave the place.
<ANS>一些人舉手說道：「這些蜘蛛網的排列可能意味著附近有蛛后。我們應該警惕！」
One of your group holds out their hand and speaks up: 'The layout of these webs could mean a Spider Queen's presence. We should be wary'

<PHASE>ID: 3
<STORY>隊伍中對動物比較有研究的人聚在一起討論。花費時間分析狀況之後，他們指向了蛛網的圖案和附近的蜘蛛卵。很明顯如果你們冒險前進，你的隊伍將面臨蛛后，或至少是牠的得意手下們。
Those with knowledge of the animal world in your party huddle together in talks. Taking their time to analyse the scene, they point to the pattern of the webs as well as signs of spider eggs in the distance. It is clear that your party may face a spider queen or at least her best minions if they risk venturing forth. 

另一方面，他們說，這樣的巢穴裡也會有珍稀資源。
On the other hand, the men inform the group that such lairs can also hold precious resources.

The men walk carefully down the path, trying their best not to touch the white network of webs around them. The pressure builds as each move feels like it's in slow motion. Just as it seems they've reached the desired spot, the herbalist reaches down for the plants only to realise they are useless weeds... In a fit of frustration he flings his arm into the air... and finds fi covered in web...

數秒之後，看上去將要吞噬整個隊伍般的蛛網開始震動，很快蜘蛛們就要來到這裡保護它們的領地了。

Your party sneaks up on the spider nest. The area is thick with spider webs and there is a stench of decomposing meat in the air. It is hard to make out exactly how many giant spiders huddle in the nest, but the party is faced with a pit full of hairy, round spider bodies, an array of long, twisted legs and tens of red eyes glowing right at them.

<PHASE>ID: 0
<STORY>一個穿著破破爛爛暗綠色斗篷的人，緩步走向你的隊伍。隨著他接近，可以清楚看到他赤裸雙足，身無長物。見到你的隊伍，他摘下了兜帽，露出了一張憔悴而疲憊的精靈臉龐。他用他發黑的，悲傷的雙眼直視著你的人們的靈魂。
A figure, clad in a ragged, dark green cloak, slowly approaches your party. As he gets closer, it is clear he is barefooted and carries nothing more than the clothes on his back. Seeing your party, the figure takes off the hood to reveal a gaunt, tired face of an Elf, with his blackened, sad eyes looking straight through the souls of your men. 

儘管明顯看出他的病弱，但它依然一身高貴的氣息，如此美麗，古老就像被神遺忘的上古物種……
Despite the evident sickliness, there remains an air of grace, a whisper of bygone beauty in the forgotten, ancient creature...

You approach the wanderer, mimicking his sign of peace. You speak up: 

「這條路對你一個人而言太過危險，你還好嗎？」
'This is a dangerous road to be roaming on your own sir, are you alright?'

對方沒有回應，所以你們進行新的嘗試。
There is no reply from the figure, and so you men make another attempt. 

當他們走近時，精靈後退並揮手示意他們遠離。
As they get closer, the elf steps back and waves at them to stay away.
<ANS>「你需要什麼幫助？你看起來病懨懨的？」
'Do you need any help? You seem sickly?'

You bear the mark of the winds of ancient magic as follower of Veles, even when it is not active. As such, you carry a drop of the elder Elven blessing within you. The stranger seems to recognise this kinship immediately. He drops down on one knee, and reaches out for help.

You viciously attack the Elven wanderer, who continues to stand in his pose. As you strike him down, tears of blood run down his cheeks as he looks at his murderers with great sadness.

隨著擁有不死身軀的古老旅行者的生命流逝，一片暗雲縈繞在空中，深深滲入你們。你嘗試逃離這古怪魔法的抓捕，但這片薄霧只是無情的跟著你。
As life fades from the once immortal body of the ancient traveller, a dark cloud lingers in the air and slowly seeps into all of you. You try to run from the clutches of the strange magic, but the mist only follows suit, relentless. 

隊員們感受到沉重的詛咒壓在靈魂之上，持續了數小時。而對於那些過於虛弱的人，永恆的黑暗結束了他們的生命。
Within hours every member of the party feels the burden of a terrible curse on their souls and for those who were too weak, eternal darkness threatens to claim their lives.

<STORY>當你拿著補給品接近時，精靈似乎感到不安。但當你把小袋子放在他面前時，他露出一個微笑並再一次鞠躬表達感謝。他拿起袋子，閉上雙眼，朝著天空和大地作手勢，你意識到那是秩序之樹的象徵。
The elf seems uneasy when you approach with the supplies, but when you place the small bag before him, he musters up a smile and bows once more in thanks. He takes the bag and closes his eyes, making a hand gesture towards the skies, the earth then the ground - you recognise this as the symbol of the Cosmic Tree. 

他離開了你的隊伍，感受到你們的善良後他的腳步變得輕盈。你們中一些人感到血液中燃起一種奇怪的力量。
The figure moves away from the party, his step clearly made lighter by the kindness of your men and some of you feel a strange energy run through your veins.
<ANS>好吧，繼續你的旅程。
Alright. Continue your journey.

<PHASE>ID: 11
<STORY>精靈長長的歎了一口氣，皺眉看著站在他面前的隊伍。他這樣做使你們背後一寒。這個陌生人用他漆黑、冰冷的目光掃視每個隊員，然後離開了。
The Elf lets out a long sigh and frowns at the group before him. As he does so, chills run down your spines. The stranger measures each of the party members with his cold, black eyes, then begins to move away. 

黑暗似乎隨著他的腳步移動，他的步伐緩慢，彷彿每一步都經過測量。
There seems to be a darkness following his steps and his pace is very slow, as if every move is a measured effort.
<ANS>這精靈是個怪胎，隨他去.

<STORY>在喝了一些水後，精靈終於開口了。他的聲音彷彿在耳邊迴響，他的語調使你們悲歎，讓你們的靈魂感到悲傷。
After drinking some water, the elf finally speaks. His voice is but a whisper that rings in your ears, and its tune makes you weep, filling your soul with unknown sorrow. 

「我們的種族曾被神聖之光祝福。我們作為神聖知識的不朽守護者和永恆的生命之歌的繼承者在西婭生活。但黑暗降臨時，很明顯我們失敗了。沒有滅亡的則被詛咒，永遠徘徊在這神聖的土地。那些想要幫助我們的人，則可能遭受相同命運。所以，朋友，請不要用你們美麗的靈魂冒險，讓我獨自面對我悲慘的命運吧。」
'My kind was once blessed with divine light. We walked Thea as immortal guardians of the sacred knowledge and the bearers of the eternal song of life. But when the Darkness came, it was clear we had failed. Those who did not perish remain cursed, forever wandering this hallowed earth. Those who try to help us, risk sharing our fate. So please, friends, risk not your beautiful souls, and leave me to my wretched fate.'

儘管籠罩著黑暗，當精靈說話時，你們感到精神振奮，十分奇異。你們中一些人變得更加自信。
Despite the overbearing darkness, you feel strangely uplifted when the elf speaks and some of you become more confident in themselves.
<ANS>「就放著你這樣離開好像不對，我能幫你什麼嗎？」

<STORY>你拿出新鮮的雞的屍體，將雞血灑在茫然看著你的精靈的臉上。你用左腳跳舞，並向你的神祈求力量。你編織著魔法之風，用它把精靈的心臟保護起來，驅散一些黑暗。他看起來很震驚，說道：
You take out the fresh carcass of a chicken, you spread the blood on the face of the Elf, who stares at you blankly. You perform a dance on your left foot, and you call out to your Gods for power. You weave the winds of magic and create a protective shield that now runs through the stranger’s heart, lifting some of the Darkness. He looks shocked and speaks:

「我承認我未預想過一個年輕人會有這樣的力量……我是個傻瓜，把你看成區區小蟲。為了我的傲慢，我樂於成為你的僕人，直到還清我所欠下的或者等到黑暗清除。」
‘I confess I did not foresee such power among the young ones… I was a fool to discard you as mere insects. For my arrogance I shall happily be your servant, until such time as my debt be repaid, or until the Darkness is kept at bay.’
<ANS>「好吧，加入我們吧。但沒必要做僕人，當朋友就好。」
‘Alright, come join us. But there is no need for servitude, join us as friend.’

You tried to protect the elf from his darkness, but instead the evil taint has seeped into you! Your own hearts feel heavy now, and for some, this may be fatal! The Elf sees what happens and cries out:

「為什麼你們要管這遠超人類理解的力量？傻瓜！我無法影響這個詛咒產生的污染！快跑，趁它把你們全部吞噬之前趕緊跑！」
‘Why did you meddle with forces beyond your human comprehension? Fools! I cannot affect this cursed filth! Go, go now before it engulfs you all!’

The unfortunate soul stood trembling beneath the tree, unable to muster any courage. It seemed for a while that they may yet live through their ordeal, but alas, the Thunder God had other plans. 

恐懼又一次襲擊了他，這可憐的村民從樹下跑到了一片空地，佩龍的神力肆虐之後只留下一具燒焦的屍體……

<STORY>跟著斯卡莎卡留下的指示，你找到了一間老舊的工人棚屋，不自然的大霧將其隱藏，隔斷窺探的視線。周圍的空氣又冷又悶，但這霧聞起來卻像薑和蜂蜜。你越是看著這房子，越能感覺到它的誘人。
Following the instructions laid out by the Skshack, you find an old worker's hut, hidden away from prying eyes by a strange, unnatural mist. The air around this place is thick and cold, and yet, the mist smells of ginger and honey. The more you look at the house, the more alluring it becomes.

Within the house, you hear the faint laughter of children, followed by sporadic sobs and even screams.

Some in your party have heard tales of the Baba Yaga, a witch, dwelling in solitude, luring lost children into her evil clutches. 

這生物完全符合描述，所以她歇斯底里的大笑使你的一些隊友很不安。她叫道：
This creature certainly fits the bill, so some of your party feel very unsettled as the witch laughs hysterically:

「來呀，來燒死我啊。他們都這麼說，也都這麼做。但火焰屬於我，它溫柔地懷抱我的孩子們，但絕不會傷害我，絕不會……」
‘Burn me, burn me you will. That is what they all say, that is what they all try. But fire is mine, it holds my babes in its warm clutches, but, it will not have me, alas it will not…’

那女人又對你張開雙臂，你看到她變形的乳房不自然的接近你，召喚著你靠近，而孩子們的哭泣聲也越發響亮。
The woman spreads her arms out to you again, her deformed breasts, unnaturally reaching for you, beckoning you to come closer and all the while the cries of children get louder.

As you strike the final blow, her body goes limp and a surge of sickly green cloud explodes into the air. The cloud enters into your body and into your bodies, but worse yet, you can all feel the strange powers reaching inside you and spreading to everyone you hold dear, even those who are afar!

妖婆雅加詛咒了你和你的村民！
You and all the people of your village now suffer from the Curse of Baba Yaga!

Before you, stands a tall, ragged woman, with wild eyes and a crooked grin on her face. She wears a torn up dress, sadly revealing her dried up, long breasts; she has long, sharp nails and her hair is wildly dishevelled. Perhaps she was once a young, even a pretty woman, but the form that stands before you now is worn down by forces beyond nature. She stretches out her hands before you:

She was once a mother, who lost her children to a sudden, brutal death, forced to watch helplessly as her kin perished in torment. Her soul died along with her children, yet her body did not, thus leaving a creature tormented from within, driven to utter madness and despair!

有些可憐的女人就此成為了傳說中的女巫。她們瘋狂地尋找孩子，試著去關愛他們，卻沒意識到死亡是她們唯一能給孩子的禮物。而孩子們的死又讓她們變得更加瘋狂了。
Some of these poor women indeed become the witches from the tales. In their madness, they seek out children and try to care for them, only to realise that death is their sole gift. This drives them ever deeper into the depths of insanity.

<PHASE>ID: 0
<STORY>你聽到附近灌木叢裡傳來一陣奇怪的騷亂，是一種夾雜著尖嘯聲和餓狗嘟囔聲的聲音。
You hear a strange commotion coming from the nearby bushes, a sort of cross between a squeak and a deep grumble of a salivating dog. 

隨著你靠近，你看到了一個奇怪的棕色球狀生物正盯著你看，牠有著又大又黃的眼睛和亂糟糟的毛髮。這東西和狐狸差不多大，有蝙蝠一樣的翅膀，笑起來露出一排鋒利的牙齒，而且聞起來很糟糕。顯然牠被困在某種陷阱中了，你認出那陷阱是獸人放的。
As you approach, you see a weird looking, brown ball of dishevelled fur, with big, yellow eyes staring back at you. The creature is no bigger than a fox and, has bat like wings, a snarly smile with a range of sharp teeth and it smells badly. It is apparently stuck in some hunter's trap. You recognise the trap to be Orc-made.
<ANS>別管這東西了，這裡可能有獸人，他們可不喜歡你搶走他們的獵物。
Leave the creature be, there may be Orcs about and they may not like you poaching their prey.

那小傢伙瘋狂的點頭，還一直因為扎進牠身體的陷阱尖叫。
The creature nods frantically, still squealing from the trap digging into its little body.

你一放開斯卡莎卡，牠就跛著腳遠離了你。走了幾步後，牠停下來，抬頭看著你說：「你要吃了我嗎？」
You release the Skshack and as you do so, it tries to hobble away from you. After a few steps it stops, looks up, and squeaks, before speaking up:'Are you going to eat me?'

'Oh I am thanking you! Grumble… grumble… I speak your speech not well, but I try to tell you. Weak is my body, I smile as I join Mokosh in the dirt soon in peacefulness. Thanking you friends. 

你們叫我們斯卡莎卡，家事惡魔，真是可笑的名字。唔……嗯……似是而非。因為你們友好，所以我要警告你們關於屋子的事情。
Your tongue calls me Skshack and House Demon, funny names. Grumble… squeak…And so I am both and none. But I tell you now of a house, because you friends and good and I warn you.

屋子曾充滿快樂和笑聲，曾是魔法與美食之地。然後黑暗時代降臨，我不再是惡魔，不再幫助我的女主人，我因為女主人作惡多端而哭泣。她不再是我過去的女主人，不再歡樂，僅剩悲傷、憤怒和死亡，但沒有消逝。或者說，有生命，但沒有活著。
Once there was house and there was joy and laughter. Once it was a place of magics and yummy foods. Then the darkened time came and no longer a demon I was, no longer helped my mistress, I cried as my eyes looked on her evil. No longer my lady, no more joy, all sad and angry and dead, but not gone, or alive but not living.

我告訴你這屋子，因為你幫我逃脫骯髒的陷阱。你們，好人，所以請幫助我的女主人，解放她的束縛。她才可能歸於塵土，停止她極惡的瘋狂。
I tell you the house, because you help me from the nasty trap, you good people, so please help my mistress now, free her from her trap and she may be dirt with me and stop her bad, bad madness.’

這小傢伙躺倒在地上，痛苦地抱住肚子，然後在你眼前分解成了一堆泥土。他用最後一口氣說：「小心，朋友……她吃……她瘋了……得到了寶藏……讓她解脫！」
The creature falls onto the ground, clutching its stomach in pain, and before your very eyes it begins to disintegrate into dirt. With its last breath it goes on:'Beware friends… she eats…. She’s crazy… got treasures…. Set her free!'

斯卡莎卡消失了，留下的只有一片紙，上面畫著一張很潦草的地圖。

黑霧令人想起黑暗時代，西婭永遠處於它的支配之下。
The Black Mist remains a malicious reminder of the days of Darkness, and their everlasting hold on Thea.

黑雲慢慢滲入世界的每一個角落，令人窒息的黑暗能量像毯子一樣包裹住所有人，即使是最勇敢的靈魂也感到了突如其來的恐懼。
Even the bravest of souls feel a sudden dread as the black cloud slowly seeps into every corner of their surroundings and wraps them up in a suffocating blanket of dark energy. 

你發誓在黑暗中看到了扭曲的面孔，聽到無聲的尖叫。你感到從脊髓向下蔓延的寒意，冷汗遍體，渾身顫抖。你的靈魂已經被那黑霧所侵染了。

It seems like an eternity passes, your spirit is nearly depleted, but eventually, you feel the warmth of the sun on your face. Slowly, you muster up the courage to open your eyes and rise again.

You have survived!  But alas, not everyone comes out unscathed!

It does not lessen some of the dread you feel from merely looking at the dark matter, madly twisting and turning to try and reach you, but its effects do not reach your soul.

護盾能夠抵禦黑霧的侵襲，但你可以選擇更進一步，試著對抗黑霧！

You try to huddle together, hoping that the closeness of your comrades will strengthen your resolve. And indeed for a while it does. You crouch down on the ground, clench your jaws, close your eyes and hold on tight to those sharing your fate.

It seems like an eternity passes, your spirit is nearly depleted, but eventually, you feel the warmth of the sun on your face. Slowly, you muster up the courage to open your eyes and rise again.

I have mastered the arts of illusion to the point where I am able to project my own image in physical form. It is draining and doesn’t last long. But alas, it did the trick!

The old man smiles and even though he looks tired and worn out, there is an evil spark in his eye. As you look around the room, you realise that in the corners, hidden deep in the shadows, lie piles of what looks like human bones.

<STORY>你沿著常走的路前行，穿過枯寂的平原。這平原不斷提醒著你西婭悲慘的命運。
You travel along the beaten path, through the dried up plains that remain a constant reminder of Thea’s sad fate. 

斥候在遠處發現了一堆小小的營火，旁邊坐著一個孤獨的老人。
From a distance, your scouts spot a small campfire and report that there is a lonesome old man sitting there. 

斥候確認周圍沒有其他生物，老人也沒持有任何武器。事實上他們只看到一捆包裹和一根手杖。
The scouts have confirmed that there are no other creatures to be seen, nor does the man hold any visible weapons. In fact they report only a small bundle and a stick.
<ANS>老傢伙獨自一人坐在那兒，嗯……避開營火。
Old fella sittin' on his lonesome, yeah… Avoid the campfire.
<ANS>好吧，這散發著麻煩的氣息，但管他呢。接近營火。

<PHASE>ID: 1
<STORY>你走近了營火邊，老人如同斥候報告的那樣，蒼老、衣衫襤褸，除了一捆包裹以及一根手杖之外身無長物。事實上他只是躺在營火邊，十分虛弱。他害怕地看著你，攤開雙手：
You approach the campfire and the old man is just as the scouts reported, old, ragged, with none else than a small bundle and a walking stick. He is, in fact, lying by the fire and clearly very weak. He looks at you, scared, and holds out his arms:

「請不要傷害我。我不值得你動怒。你可以搜我的行李，這裡面沒什麼好東西，只有一些水和陳腐的麵包。如果你想要的話拿去吧。」
‘Please don’t hurt me. I have nothing worth your ire. You can search my luggage and you’ll find nought more than some water and stale bread. If you want it, it is yours.’

一眼看去，這行李裝不了什麼東西。
A glance at the bundle confirms that it could hold little more.
<ANS>「我們不想要你的東西。你一個老人獨自在野外做什麼？」

You examine the man, and find no physical wounds, but it is clear he is dying. Probably just from old age.

老人微笑著朝你低下了頭：
The old man smiles and bows his head:

「感謝你們。這年頭很少見到這麼友善的人。我的故事沒什麼出奇的地方。我曾擁有子民，但他們先我一步而去，所以我就獨自行走西婭，想辦法活下去。但我太老了，無法適應新地方，因此我坐在這兒等待死亡。所以，正如你所見，我沒什麼東西給你。但你們很友善，給，拿上這藏寶圖。它也許會帶你找到我已經不可能享有的寶藏。」
‘Thank you. It is not often you see kindness these days. My story is nothing if not predictable. I had people, they died, I did not and so I have been walking Thea alone, looking for ways to live. I am too old to settle in a new place, in fact, I have sat here waiting for death to take me. So you see, you truly have nothing to take from me. But, because you were kind, here, have this map. It may lead you to some treasures that are beyond my grasp.’

他說完最後一個字便閉上了雙眼安靜地躺下了，他的呼吸變得微弱，也許他陽壽已盡。
With his last words the old man falls quiet and closes his eyes, his breath becomes shallow and you think his time has come.
<ANS>老人瀕臨死亡，或是病入膏肓。陪伴老人過完最後的人生，然後離開。

You take the small bundle and check its contents. It is, as he said, a small skin sack with water and a portion of stale bread. But, what attracts your attention is the piece of paper that the bread is wrapped in. You look at it closely and realise it is a map of these parts with some particular point of interest marked in red.

老人看你正看著地圖便說道：
The old man sees you reading the map and says:

「喔，這東西。我前些日子找到了它，我原以為我能去那兒試試看能不能找到些有價值的東西。但你想要的話就拿上它吧。我生病了，不能再探險了。」
‘Oh, this thing. I found it some time ago and I thought I may try to see if there is anything of value in there. But, of course you may take it if you wish. I am ill and will no longer face any adventures.’

這人顯然已沒有什麼力氣了，但他盡力了。
The man clearly has no more strength in him, but he tries his best.
<ANS>「好吧老頭。今天你很幸運。」帶上東西離開。
‘Alright old man. It’s your lucky day.’ Take the stuff and walk away.

The map leads you to the ruins of some old town. There are very few houses still visible, let alone standing, but there is one. It is clearly touched by the Darkness.

<STORY>幾秒前森林似乎還很寧靜，但瞬間就充滿敵意。
如果樹可以皺眉，那麼眼前的樹就一定是在這樣做。它再次以一種輕柔耳語般的聲音說道：
The forest that seemed so serene just seconds ago, suddenly feels a lot more hostile. 
If trees could frown you think this one would. It speaks again, this time in a soft, whispering voice:

「是的，你的意圖很明顯，我是鹿首精，這片森林的守護者。現在讓我們來談談怎麼放了你們。實際上你很幸運。有個流浪者布蓋藏在我們無法觸及之地，而你的伶俐雙腿能幫你快速趕到那個地方，而且很顯然，你們可以毫不遲疑前往你們不該去的地方。所以對於追捕布蓋一事，你怎麼說？作為交換，我們會給你獎勵。或者，我們也能殺掉你們所有人。隨你選吧，無所謂……」
‘Yesss, it is pretty clear what your intentionsss were, I am Leshy, the guardian of these woods. Now let’s discusss how you may leave here with your livesss. You are in fact in luck. We have a rogue Bugay, hiding in a place we cannot follow, and you have these useful legs of yoursss that can carry you to places fast, and no qualms about going into placessss you shouldn’t, obviousssly. Ssso what sssay you to hunting the Bugay? In exchange, we will alssso reward you with a gift. Or, we could kill you all. Don’t care either way…’

‘Wise choice and it isss unexpectedly fortunate for us both. This Bugay I speak of is a lost spirit, confused… defiant… He has forgotten his duty as the guardian spirit, he has defiled his own spirit companions, made them rabid and vile… We cannot have such things. I shall tell you where he is. Make haste!’

鹿首精指出了它認為的布蓋藏身之處。同時他還給了你獎勵，你覺得這上面附著一些靈魂魔法。
The Leshy points you to where he thinks the escaped Bugay may be hiding. He also hands you a reward and you feel it came with some sort of spirit magic.

森林仍然存在，但又一次變得虛弱，枯萎，乾涸，幾乎成了不毛之地。

<STORY>你拿出一些儲存的黃金，放到了村內廣場。利科妖立刻前來搶奪，化身為一隻毛茸茸的哥布林一樣的小生物，隨即粘上了黃金。幾分鐘後它隱去身形，但你能感覺到那不祥的存在。
You gather up some gold from your stock and you place it in the village square. The Liho arrives promptly to claim her prize and as she does, she shifts into a furry, goblin-like critter that attaches itself to the goods. Within a few minutes it becomes invisible, but you feel its nasty presence.

你把這燙手山芋送給了毫無戒心的陌生人，他們還以為發現了什麼值錢的東西……
You pass the parcel on to some unsuspecting strangers, who think they found a random treasure stash…

數日後，你聽說附近強盜瘋狂搶劫，應該沒那麼巧吧……
Within days, you hear of bandits attacking people in anger in the area, surely they’re not the same people…
<ANS>嘛，至少利科妖走了……

<PHASE>ID: 8
<STORY>欺騙利科妖的方法之一是讓它追逐你。被追到後，它會坐在你的肩膀上，用最惡毒的方法讓你痛不欲生。而你，則需要跑進小溪或河流內，裝作淹死的樣子。這樣利科妖才會自認為取得勝利，去尋找下一個目標。畢竟，它是追求刺激的惡魔。
One way to trick a Liho is to make it chase you. It will then sit on your shoulder and taunt you in the most vicious ways. You must then run into a lake, or river, and you must pretend you have drowned. The Liho will think itself victorious and it will float away to seek other victims, for it is a demon ever searching for new thrills.

當然了，這個方法需要你裝死，而不是真死……
The trick is of course, to stay alive while you pretend…
<ANS>也許該用金飾作誘餌……
Perhaps try with the trinkets after all…

<STORY>你最強的勇士們挑戰這個任務。利科妖站在他們的肩膀上，開始將他們折磨至絕望。
Your best people take on the challenge, the Liho mounts their shoulders, and one by one, it tries to taunt them into despair. 

他們忍耐著，然後一個又一個地跳下水，裝作被淹死的樣子。利科妖非常滿意，一邊大笑，一邊離開了你的村莊。
They persevere and jump into the water, pretending to drown. The Liho satisfied with its victory laughs and leaves your village! 

至於那些從從水裡活下來的英雄們，則感覺自己更強了。
Those who emerge from the waters, feel strengthened by their deed.
<ANS>不錯，至少利科妖沒了。

Your best people take on the challenge, the Liho mounts their shoulders, and one by one, it tries to taunt them into despair. They persevere and jump into the water, pretending to drown. Alas, one of your people can’t hold their breath and as they emerge to take up air, they struggle to the point of exhaustion! You fear they may not recover from this.

利科妖爆發出邪惡的大笑，但至少它離開了，對惡行心滿意足……

<STORY>長老們聚集在村莊大堂，將雞斬首，其頭作為祭品獻上，並吟唱聖歌。突然，一個又瘦又高的黑衣女子出現在大家面前。她臉頰凹陷，頭髮散落。更可怕的是，她單眼睥睨著村莊。
The elders gathered in the village hall, a chicken was beheaded, a song sung and the right words spoken. Thus was revealed a lean, tall woman garbed in black. Her cheeks sunken, her hair ragged and worst of all, only one eye glaring at the village gathering. 

就在她出現的時候，召喚她的智者倒下了，雙手撞上地面，手骨骨折的聲音清晰可聞。那位女性如同出現時那樣迅速消失。現在，你的村莊脫離了利科妖的威脅。
Just as she appeared, the wise one in charge of the summoning slipped and fell hard on their hand, breaking it with an audible crunch. The female was gone as quickly as she came, and for now, your village is free and you have learnt of this Liho.

但是長老們告訴你，她以後一定還會再回來的，並且帶來厄運和疾病。因為，她是利科妖…

You have beaten the wraiths, still unsure of where they came from, or their connection to the Liho. The Liho is gone, but you hear her manic laughter echoing in your ears… 

次日夜晚，利科妖並沒有來臨。你不確定是因為你把她打跑了，或是什麼其他原因把她趕走了。長老們搖著頭，對你說他們有一種預感，那就是利科妖一定會回來，而且會加倍奉還……
She does not return the next night, but you are unsure if it is your attack, or something entirely different that made her go. Your elders shake their heads and fists vowing that the Liho will one day return for more…
<ANS>好吧，至少她現在走了。

The Striga is not only bloodthirsty, it is known to devour your insides too. Worse yet, it is said that the creature’s only link to its lost humanity is the love it once bore and so it haunts its former loved ones and their bloodlines for eternity!

‘Burn the red string in the furnace you say. And you got the lock of her hair. Well I’ll be damned, you did it lassie! I am impressed. Rusalka’s hair is sacred, magic some say, she would not give it to anyone and if she was dead, her hair would be water. Thank you!’

‘Eh your village, aye. Well truth be told, I move around me, and I don’t like just any stranger coming to see me. Unless I want you to, you will not find your way here. Hence the invite.

現在說說為什麼我會讓你們找到我。我有個小問題。如果你幫忙，我會給你一副全套盔甲和一些好武器。你看，我有個，嗯，女性問題……」

畢竟，沒有矮人女性會選擇這麼悲慘的命運，至少我認識的人裡沒有。無論如何，長話短說，有個可愛的惡魔女孩——提醒你，她很漂亮——住在附近，而且，我試著用我的鍛工給她留下深刻印象，但是她不喜歡武器。我試了甜言蜜語，可是結果不太令人滿意。
After all, no Dwarven woman chose this sad fate, at least not one I know of. In any case, the story cut short, there is a cute demon girl – the nice type mind you - livin’ nearby, and well, I tried impressing her with my smithing, but she doesn’t like weapons, I tried sweet talkin’ but turns out it ain’t my best feature.

‘This is a serious matter, mind you. She can get a bit nasty if you’re not careful, and I’ve been tryin’ for decades now. Anyway, I don’t know how much you do know of them Water Demons, but just try not to dance with her, and probably avoid going for a swim, and well, just be careful, she’s a sneaky one.’

‘Hey, hold your horses human, what’s with the racism eh? Just you wait till you see ’er, then tell me datin’ Demons is off the menu. You know us Dwarves, we have good heads for that enchantment shit, so I figure she ain’t gonna bedazzle me or anything, and you know, I think we’ll get along just fine.’

He points to a direction, but seeing no recognition from you, he adds:

「那是一片貧瘠困苦的土地，就像西婭其他地方一樣。多年來我們一直把那裡當作家園。然而，我們居住在河邊，因此大量水鬼迫使我們不得不離開家園。」

‘Well, in all honesty, not so much. 
We can trade one simple weapon, we don’t have the manpower to wield it anyway – but we’ll only trade that for fruit and herbs to keep us healthy.

<PHASE>ID: 20
<STORY>自從我們的世界與冥界之間的阻隔被破壞，夢魔便肆虐大地。你的人們夜晚輾轉反側，不過這次的噩夢有所不同，它沒有讓人們變得虛弱，反而在之後的日子裡讓人們變得剛毅且積極向上！
Since the veil between our world and the underworld has been torn, the Mares have become a common sight. Your people lie restless at night, but the nightmares seem different this night and instead of weariness they bring fortitude and good will for the days to come!

<STORY>好吧，傳言說女人們的靈魂會化為夢魔並帶來噩夢與苦痛，但是……你確定要殺掉所有女性來換取免受夢魔襲擊的那一點可能性？或許我們可以先試試其它的辦法？
Right, the folktales do state that it is the spirits of women who travel as Mares to bring bad dreams and torment, but... are you sure you want to KILL ALL WOMEN, to possibly, ward you from Mares? Maybe try something else first?
<ANS>好吧，那就不殺女人們了。
Oh ok, let's not kill the women.
<ANS>是的，如果是女人們惹的禍，就殺了她們！
Yup, if women cause it, kill them!

<STORY>一隻奇怪的黑色大公雞正在巡視你的穀倉。
An unusually big and strange looking black rooster was seen perusing your village barn.

你猜測這可能是一隻作物精靈——一種被馴化的田地惡魔，能給他的主人帶來好運。不過需要注意的是，如果它認定你是個糟糕的農民的話，它反而會破壞你的莊稼或者幹一些骯髒的勾當！
You suspect this may be a Cropsy – a domesticated Field Demon, who can bring great fortune to its host. But beware, if it deems you to be a bad farmer, it may instead damage your crops or play nasty tricks!

A group of voluptuous, tall women, covered in long fur, with large, droopy eyes descend from the mountaintop! They are carrying heavy clubs.

你知道她們是荒野女巨人——傳說她們在山頂上是靠吃男人們度過黑暗時代的！甚至還有傳言說她們與山地巨魔通婚。簡而言之，沒有半點好傳聞……
You know them to be the Wildwives – fabled to have survived the Darkness in the mountain tops by feeding on their menfolk! Other tales have them paired up with mountain Trolls, as their feral brides. In short, there are no good stories about these girls…

<STORY>你想要逃跑，但是她們速度更快。奇怪的是，她們一直跟在你後面，保持距離——就像在玩一場貓鼠遊戲。她們似乎並沒有惡意，還有兩個荒野女巨人試圖接近你。
You tried running, but they were faster. The strange thing is, they seemed to be running besides you, then took over, then just kept their distance – as if the run was some game. They do not seem aggressive. A couple try to come closer to you.
<ANS>好，看看會發生什麼。

<STORY>荒野女巨人們放慢了步伐，小心翼翼向你靠近，然後停在了恰好能夠對話的距離。不過她們始終舉著大棒，沒有放鬆警惕。
The Wildwives slow their descent and approach you cautiously, stopping at a speaking distance, but their large clubs are raised in a defensive stance. 

一番觀察之後，你不太確定她們是身上長毛還是穿著奇怪的盔甲。更進一步仔細觀察後，你意識到她們還是很像人的，只是荒野生活的磨練讓她們變得不那麼「文明」罷了。
其中一個荒野女巨人深深地吸了一口氣，用低沉粗啞的聲音說道：
Now that you look closer upon them, you’re no longer sure if they have fur, or perhaps they’re just wearing strange armour, and up close, they no longer look so inhuman, just scarred by the wilderness and clearly not used to ‘civilised’ contact.
One of them sniffs the air, then speaks to you in a low, gruff voice:

「你，和我們交談嗎？」
‘You talk to us?’
<ANS>「哦，好的，沒問題。」
‘Ehm, ok, why not.’

<ANS>她們真該死！
Damn them!

<STORY>這個女人似乎沒懂你的意思。但當你向她展示你的貨物時，她明白了，同樣展示了她的東西。她放了一小箱某種金屬在地上，然後示意你也這麼幹。很明顯，她們不想再和你交流了。
The woman seems unsure of what you mean. But when you take out your goods and show them to her, she does the same. You see a small crate of some metals. She places them on the ground and gestures for you to do the same. Clearly they do not wish to have any contact with you.

Another night falls over Thea and restless souls of the damned seek out the living in envy and anger. You can almost feel the approaching wave of these infernal wraiths seeking to burden your souls! 

但今夜，陰影之中出現了一位受歡迎的賓客：一隻侍魂魔，靈魂追獵者。這種奇特的生物就像一隻巨大的癩蛤蟆，有著長長的爪子、黃色的肉疣和一口剃刀般的尖牙。實際上，它們是韋萊斯的忠實奴僕。曾經它們的任務是追捕肆意妄為的靈魂和行為不端的怨靈。但現在，他們卻絕望地吞食了過多惡靈，並且還將永久吞食下去！
But this night, a welcomed guest is seen in the shadows: a Lapiduch, the Spiritcatcher. This bizarre looking creature, resembling an overgrown toad, with long claws, yellow warts and a row of razor sharp teeth, is actually a humble servant of Veles, in the old days, tasked with the hunting of wayward souls and misbehaved wraiths, but now, hopelessly overfed and ever busy with his task of devouring evil spirits!

A child of perhaps six, stands in your way. As you get closer to him, you see the child is no ordinary human. His skin is silvery, his eyes seem golden, his hair looks like strands of very thin metal and as he hops around gleefully, you hear the clunking of coins.

The boy does not answer only smiles at you and starts to play with a ball, but he remains close to your group, and glances at you from time to time, as if waiting for something. His golden eyes measure you with the tenacity of a wild cat playing with its prey.

你覺得這可能就是傳說中的寶藏童子，一種能夠帶來財富的低等運勢惡魔！但是怎麼才能得到財富呢？它肯定有什麼秘密，是藏在腦袋裡，臉上，還是身體裡？

<PHASE>ID: 0
<STORY>你來到一座小村莊的廢墟，山丘上還有一座莊園。整個地區破敗不堪，到處雜草叢生，死亡植株的籐蔓四處蔓延——這種植物是黑暗時代的悲慘遺物，它們生長所需的不是陽光，而是死亡本身。這座莊園看起來也沒什麼不同，但它依然堅挺著沒有倒塌，誰知道它裡面有著什麼東西。
You come across ruins of a small village, with a grand manor house on the top of a hillside. The whole area is now rotten, overgrown with weeds and dark vines of the deathplant – a sad remnant of the dark days, a plant that needs no sun to grow and seems to feed on death itself. The manor house looks no different, but it does still stand, so who knows what it may hold within.
<ANS>進入莊園主宅。
Enter the manor house.
<ANS>不，沒看起來那麼簡單。離開。
Nope, don’t like the looks of this. Leave.

<PHASE>ID: 1
<STORY>這座老房子之前肯定屬於一個非常富裕的家族，不過已經荒廢了很多年。空氣中瀰漫著腐爛的氣息，窗戶全都破了。傢俱或其它有價值的東西要麼已經腐朽，要麼在很久之前就被洗劫了。
The old house must have belonged to a very wealthy family, but it has been clearly abandoned for decades. The air is stale, the windows broken, any furniture, or other valuables, either rotten away or looted long ago. 

不過，地下室吸引了你的注意。堅固金屬製成的門依然完好無損，門前散落著許多破損的工具，臨時製成的破門錘和曲桿。無論門後的東西是什麼，它一定完好無損。
門上沒有明顯的鎖孔，但是有許多洞和槓桿，應該是某種特殊的機械結構門鎖。你可以用工具撬開它，或者試著弄清楚機械結構的原理。
However, the basement draws your attention. The doors are made of solid metal and remain intact. Scattered around the doors, are remains of some broken tools, makeshift rams and bent levers. Whatever stands beyond these doors remains secured.
There is no obvious lock, but there are a series of holes and levers, suggesting an opening mechanism of some sorts. With tools, you can either try to pry it open, or you can try and figure out how this thing works.

You pry the door open and find a small vault inside. In the centre, you discover the skeletal bodies of an Orc family, huddled together. They must have hidden here in hopes of escaping the Darkness…

這裡的許多東西都已經腐壞了，不過你在屍體懷裡發現一些有用的東西，包括許多工程學的書籍。

<PHASE>ID: 1
<STORY>隨著你一步步深入森林，周圍的樹木也變得越來越高大。許多樹木都已經枯萎發黑，或被黑暗所扭曲，但是這裡依然是你所見過最歎為觀止的地方。你的周圍環繞著神秘和魔法的氣息。
As you delve deeper and deeper into the forest, the trees become taller and stronger with every step. Many are darkened, withered, or twisted by the Darkness, but still, they are more glorious than anything you’ve seen so far. There is an air of mystery and magic around you. 

你抬頭仰望，卻發現這些樹木另有玄機。緩緩地，就好像有一層霧從你眼前消散，你看見了吊橋，建成樹木形狀的房屋，由下至上的盤旋樓梯，甚至還有雕塑和被遺棄很久的燈塔。這一定是一座精靈都市！
When you look up you begin to see the trees are more than they seem. Slowly ,as if some mist is lifted from your eyes, you see hanging bridges, then the frames of houses built into the trees themselves, stairwells winding up from the roots to the very top, even sculptures and long forgotten lantern holders. This must have been an Elven city!
<ANS>湊近看看！
Take a closer look!

<PHASE>ID: 2
<STORY>這座城市必定有著輝煌的過去。但是你現在才發現它，真不知道以前為什麼會沒發現這座城。
The city has seen better days for sure. Now that you see it, you have no idea how you missed it before. 

每棵樹、每座橋和每幢房子都十分宏偉壯麗，但是看上去都十分空虛。不只是因為沒有生命，而且還有一股深深的孤獨和哀傷。
Every tree, bridge and house is grand and beautiful, but they look empty, not only because there seems to be no life here, but there is a much deeper sense of solitude and sadness. 

當你觸碰其中一棵樹時，手上感受到了一層粉末。你意識到所有的樹木都被籠罩在一層稀薄的灰色餘燼之中。
When you touch one of the trees, you feel a soft powder on your hands, and you realise that all of them are covered in a thin layer of grey ash.
<ANS>試圖爬上其中一棵樹。

<ANS>最好別，還是離開吧。

You try to climb up using one of the wonderfully carved winding staircases that should lead you right to the top of this wondrous city. You soon realise the grey ash is also very slippery, so it will be a real challenge to go up.
<ANS>嘗試攀爬。【體力】
Try it anyway.  [Physical]
<ANS>算了吧。
Nah, leave it.

<PHASE>ID: 5
<STORY>你小心翼翼地前進，在艱苦跋涉之後，你總算到達了頂部！這裡的景色美得令人窒息。
You step very carefully, and after much effort, you finally reach the top! The view from up here is breath-taking. 

整座城市建立在樹冠之上，與森林融為一體。製作精巧的木雕妝點著房屋，五彩斑斕的水晶點綴著樹枝間的迴廊。夜晚，這些水晶將化為點點星辰照亮整座城市。每座建築都傾注心血，堪稱為藝術品。你懷疑這些設計究竟實用與否，但是毫無疑問，這是視覺的饕餮盛宴。
A whole city grows within these treetops as if it were a natural part of the forest, and yet, the houses are refined with intricate wooden carvings, the passageways amongst the tree branches adorned with colourful crystal formations that must have been used for lighting in the past and every building seems like it was made with passion and artistry. You doubt how practical this was, but it is extraordinary for sure.

<STORY>這次攀爬相當費時費力，儘管你最終爬到了頂部，但卻虛脫了！
The climb up proved to be very tricky, and although you eventually make it up, you feel strangely weakened by the effort!

上方的景色美得令人窒息。整座城市建立在樹冠之上，與森林融為一體。製作精巧的木雕妝點著房屋，五彩斑斕的水晶點綴著樹枝間的迴廊。夜晚，這些水晶將化為點點星辰照亮整座城市。每座建築都傾注心血，堪稱為藝術品。你懷疑這些設計究竟實用與否，但是毫無疑問，這是視覺的饕餮盛宴。
The view from up here is breath-taking. A whole city grows within these treetops as if it were a natural part of the forest, and yet the houses are refined with intricate wooden carvings, the passageways amongst the tree branches adorned with colourful crystal formations that must have been used for lighting in the past and every building seems like it was made with passion and artistry. You doubt how practical this was, but it is extraordinary for sure.

<STORY>你搜索了很多房屋，仔細而小心翼翼，以免失足墜落而死。你發現了已經佈置好準備舉行宴會的餐廳，放置著床鋪的臥室，堆滿玩具的娛樂室，甚至還有軍械庫！但，當你想要碰觸任何東西時，它就會在你眼前變成灰燼！
You search through many houses, still slowly and carefully so not to fall to your deaths. You find dining rooms set up for a feast, sleeping chambers with beds made up, playrooms with toys lying ready for use and even an armoury! Alas, when you try to touch anything, it turns into ash before your eyes!

當你困惑地站在房間裡時，一個溫柔而又悲傷的聲音在耳邊響起：
As you stand baffled in one such room, a soft, sad voice speaks to you:

「所以你沿著我的道路前進，並如我所願來到這裡。歡迎，年輕人。我是愛麗絲，曾經是銀橡木一族，現在，嗯……只是徘徊於過去的記憶吧。」
‘And thus you have followed my path and stand before me as I hoped. Welcome young ones. I am Alys once of the Silveroak people, now, well a memory of the past I suppose.’

當你回頭，一位身形修長的精靈站在你面前。她穿著綠色盔甲，有著一頭灰色長髮。要不是這空洞無神的雙眼和覆蓋著灰燼的皮膚，你幾乎以為這就是神的化身。
When you turn, a slender, tall Elf, garbed in green armour and long, ashen hair stands before you. Were it not for the ever empty, black eyes and the grey ash covering the soft skin, you would likely think this to be an avatar of the Gods themselves.
<ANS>「你好。你說是你引領我們來這兒的？」
‘Hello. So you say you were the one that brought us here?’
<ANS>「精靈，你不應該偷偷接近我們！我們可能會誤傷你！」
‘You shouldn’t sneak up on people Elf! We could have hurt you’
<ANS>「哦哦，精靈女士，你靠得太近了！」拔出武器。

‘I am sorry if I have startled you young ones, this was not my intent. I am the last of the old Silveroak clan and I was cursed to remain here for eternity, lest my people become ash, the same way you saw happen with any object here. As long as I remain, they are safe, but alas, never allowed to return home nor speak to me.’

<STORY>「啊，我已經一個人太久了，忘記了大地住民的急躁天性。不要害怕年輕人，我不會傷害你的。事實上正相反，因為我懇求你幫助我。你看，我被詛咒了，我希望從這宿命中解脫。」
‘Ah, I have long been alone and I have forgotten the rush nature of the land dwellers. Fear not young ones, I do not seek to do you any harm. The contrary is in fact true, as I am the one that wishes to implore you to aid me. I am cursed, you see, and I seek release from my doom.’

<ANS>「哦，好吧，詛咒是什麼呢？你是精靈，難道不應該很擅長魔法嗎？」

The Elf just nods and extends her hand towards the nearest stairway down. 

當你沿著樓梯向下走的時候，你開始覺得頭暈，視線變得模糊。到達地面的時候，你已經不太記得你為什麼會來這兒了。你四處打量這個你認為是城市的地方，但是只看到了無處不在的樹。你輕觸木頭，感覺到那只是個樹幹。那些，都是夢嗎？
As you climb down, you begin to feel dizzy and your vision becomes foggy. Once on the ground, you are no longer sure what you’re doing here. You look up where you thought there was a city, but see only trees. You touch the wood and feel only tree bark, was it all a dream?

‘I was cursed by my lover whom I scorned in the past. I cannot leave this place and no kin of mine may enter, lest they turn to ash.  I now feel the presence of my lover nearby and wish for you to ask him for my release. In return, I shall reward you with an Elven blessing upon your return.'

'Wonderful, thank you! Here, if you do go, take this ribbon and show it to him, he’ll know it was from me. Take this map I drew, it will show you where his tower now stands. His name is Zadra and beware, he is of course a mage of some great esteem.

一千個太陽週期過去了，我擔心我的意志在衰減。黑暗吞噬了大部分的族人，但我能感到還有一些人活著，生活在毀滅西婭的悲慘病痛之下。但是現在我再也不能忍受孤獨了。精靈確實擅長魔法，但是，唉，這個詛咒，就像是悲慘的黑暗自身，不能由被詛咒者驅散。只有下詛咒的人才能打破它。」

‘Oh, I apologise, I forget myself. I suppose in your measurements, it has been five hundred years. But we digress. My curse was cast by my lover, scorned and wounded, his hatred grew as strong as our love once was. You see, I chose to stay with my people, rather than leave in banishment with him and for this, he confined me to this wretched fate.

And now for my plea. I have sensed his presence nearby. And while in the past I had no recourse to reach out to him, I was able to find you this time. Please, I implore you. Go to him and beg for my release. I will give you this red ribbon, it has our initials sewn into it and he will know it is from me. Speak to him and set me free!

Dear Alma,

我本希望前往佐婭之星的村莊，因為我聽說你安全到達了那裡。但是，我在路上被一群老鼠攻擊了。這些遍地繁殖的小東西不算什麼，但是一隻老鼠咬了我的小腿！恐怕我活不過今晚了。我嘴裡已經充滿了黏黏的味道，指甲上也浮現了紅色的痕跡，我已經感染了紅皮症。我想我很快會穿過秩序之樹下方的冥土之門，離開人世了。
I was hoping to make it to the hamlet of Zorya’s Star, as I heard you found safety there, but alas, I was attacked by some rats on my way. These overgrown beasties were no real threat, but one bugger bit me on my shin! I fear I will not make it through the night. I already feel the taste of clay in my mouth and I saw the red tint on my nails, the Red Sickness has its heavy hold on me now. I shall pass through the gates under the Cosmic Tree very soon. 

如果天意讓你找到我，看到我的不幸，請找到我脖子上的鑰匙。這鑰匙能夠打開隱藏在附近洞穴裡的寶箱。我在信上標記了寶箱的位置。但是注意，我就是在那個洞穴裡被老鼠咬的！
If fate will have it that you seek me out and find this unfortunate sight, please find a key on my neck. The key opens a chest that is hidden away in a cave nearby. I marked it on this letter. But beware, it was in the cave that the damned rats got me!

親愛的，我的力量沒能保護我。告訴牧師，過去秩序之樹生長的地方，我只發現了灰燼。但是我聽說了它的種子的傳說，所以還有希望。我的任務失敗了，但也許其他人沒有失敗，以斯瓦洛格的榮耀，太陽將再次升起！
My strength fails me my love. Tell the chaplain I found only ashes where the Cosmic Tree stood, but tales of its seeds have reached my ears, so not all hope is lost. I have failed my mission, but perhaps others will not, the sun will rise again in Svarog’s glory!

’It was not that easy. Never is. You see I was a fool tricked by my own lust. A creepy looking old child haunted my dreams for months, fuelling my anger and my desire for Alys until it burned so hot, I was ready to do anything. The creature then offered me a deal and like a child I took it. 

那個生物告訴我，如果我把這條附魔了的絲帶給愛麗絲，她就會永遠屬於我，再也不會談論或見到她的族人了！我欣喜若狂地這麼做了。她接受了我的禮物，但是仍然用輕蔑的眼神看我。我跑到遇見這個生物的高塔，卡烏克暴露了他的本性，開始嘲笑我！
The creature told me that if I gave Alys this enchanted ribbon, she would be mine forever and she would not speak to, nor see her family anymore! I was overjoyed, I did it. She took my gift but scorned me still. I run to this tower, where I met the creature, and the Kauk revealed his true nature as it laughed at me! 

從那以後，她被禁錮在森林裡，我被詛咒永遠不能離開高塔。更糟糕的是，高塔每一百年只在這裡出現短短幾天！」
From that day, she is imprisoned in her forest and I am cursed to never leave this tower, worse yet, it only appears here once every hundred years for mere days!’
<ANS>「所以，你能解開詛咒麼？我有一條紅絲帶，不知道這個能不能幫上忙？」

<STORY>「我很愚蠢，向卡烏克——一個騙子惡魔——尋求幫助。這該死的東西花了好幾個月激起我強烈的憤怒，最終他提供了金燦燦的獎勵。我要把附魔了的絲帶交給愛麗絲。他發誓這樣一來，她永遠都不會再次談論或見到她的族人，並且永遠屬於我了！
‘I was a fool and I asked the Kauk – a Trickster Demon as it turn out – for aid. The damn thing had me worked up and angered for months, until finally he offered his golden reward. I was to take an enchanted red ribbon to Alyse. He swore she would never speak to, nor see her kin again and be mine forever! 

你早就知道他真正的意思。所以，她被禁錮在那兒，我被束縛在塔裡，永遠不能離開，更糟糕的是，高塔每一百年只在這裡出現短短幾天，所以我永遠沒有足夠的時間來求助！」
Only you know already what he really meant. And so, she is stuck there and I am bound to this tower, never to leave it and worse yet, it only appears here for few days every hundred years, so I can never have enough time to find help!’

獸人開始準備儀式。他脫下衣服，用接骨木提取物在身上描繪著什麼，然後把一些岩鹽灑在絲帶上，並點燃絲帶。
The Orc begins to prepare for the ritual. He takes his clothes of and paints his body with an elderberry extract, he then throws some rock salt onto the ribbon and sets it on fire.

大火熊熊燃燒，滋滋聲好像惡魔在微笑。在煙霧中，你看到了皺巴巴的孩子的臉龐。

You see the Orc twist and contort as he battles the power of the hex. You see the familiar grey ash swirling around the fire. Then it all stops!
The red flame dies, the ash drops to the ground and disappears and you see a huge smile on Zadra’s face:

「我們做到了！我自由了！謝謝你我的朋友，現在我必須去看看愛麗絲，她現在還好嗎！」
‘We did it! I am free. Thank you friends, now I must go back to Alys and see if she’s ok!’

慢慢地，你看見石塔變成了灰燼，聽到火焰裡傳來那惡魔陰險的笑聲，然後，獸人變成了石頭，在你面前粉碎。
In slow motion, you see the stone clad tower turn to dust, the menacing laughter of the creature from the flames and then, the Orc turns into stone and crumbles before you.

<STORY>她微微點頭，深深鞠躬。你看到扎達沉默地站在一邊，眼裡擎滿淚水。愛麗絲看了他一會兒，然後又轉向你：
She nods and bows her head in response. You see Zadra stands by without a word, but there are tears in his eyes. Alys looks at him for a while then turns back to you:

「向你提問，我的救星，我應該原諒他的愚蠢，還是為我的城市和命運向他復仇？」
‘I will ask you as my Saviour, should I forgive him his folly, or avenge my city and my fate?’
<ANS>「復仇！無論什麼原因，他們虛弱而自私！」
‘Avenge it! Whatever his reasons, they were weak and selfish!’
<ANS>「你們都受盡了折磨。至少和他聊聊吧。」

Alys nods and so does Zadra, accepting the verdict without a single word. Alys waves her hand and Zadra turns into a stone statue, but you see his eyes remain very much alive. Alys walks away.

But, before you can explore it, a rather small, almost child-like, yet bearded man, in a wide brimmed hat and a well cut suit appears before you. He wears several gold chains around his neck and as he opens his mouth, you see his teeth are made of diamonds!

<STORY>「人是正確答案，因為精靈在年幼時會像人類一樣爬行，長大用兩條腿行走，但年紀大的精靈根本就不像人類一樣衰老，所以他們年老時不需要用枴杖。
你很聰明，看起來你可以接受真正的挑戰。」
'Man is the correct answer, for the Elven kin do crawl as babes as man does, they then walk on two legs as you do, yet the elder children do not age as humans do and thus will not likely use a crane for a third leg in old age.
You are wise and ready to begin the real challenge.'

'Your answer is incorrect. The Elves and Men are akin to each other as both are the children of Thea and in principle both are born, mature then become old. But alas, the Elven kin’s bodies do not age and so they need not the third leg.

the rich need it,

<ANS>魔法
Magic
<ANS>沒有
Nothing
<ANS>兩者都是
Both

<PHASE>ID: 18
<STORY>你的選擇很有趣。魔法可以比神更偉大，窮人很容易能得到魔法，沒有富人可以找到代替它的力量，因此富人需要它以維持權力。確實，如果你吃了魔法，你會死亡。雖然有些人認為惡魔以魔法為食，而精靈之所以不死也是因為魔法維持其靈魂——但這都只是理論。
An interesting choice you made. Magic can be greater than Gods, the poor can have it easily and no riches in the world can substitute its power, thus the rich need it to stay in power, and yes, if you eat it you will likely die. Although some say Demons feed of magic itself and live, and that Elves are immortal because magic sustains their souls – but these are theories. 

但是，『沒有』也是正確答案。這取決於你的信仰。作為莫樂娜的追隨者，我不希望你如此高估魔法……
However, Nothing fits the bill just as well, depending on your religious views. As followers of Morena, I would not expect you to think so highly of Magic…

’Nothing is certainly the correct answer yes, but is Magic so wrong? 
Magic can be greater than Gods, the poor can have it easily and no riches in the world can substitute its power, thus the rich need it to stay in power, and yes, if you eat it you will likely die. Although some say demons feed off magic itself and live, and that Elves are immortal because magic sustains their souls – but these are theories.

<STORY>第一個筆記，書寫優美，無可挑剔，整潔清晰。它寫道：
我們的任務失敗了。我們失職了嗎？我們放棄他們太早了嗎，或許我們從一開始就不應該這麼做？我們應該更積極地保護神聖支柱？我必須去常青樹林尋找答案。
Note One, is written in a beautiful style, impeccable, neat and very distinct. It reads:
And so our duty failed. Did we fail our charges? Did we abandon them too soon, or were we never supposed to do so in the first place? Should we have guarded the Sacred Pillars more vigorously? I must go to the Evergreen Grove and find answers.

有一張古老的地圖，上面標出了一片小樹林——經過了這麼久，地點很難確定，但你確實認出了一些地標。還有五片銀色樹皮，散發著神奇的力量。
There is an old map, with the grove marked upon it – it won’t be easy to follow after all this time, but you do recognise some landmarks. There are also five pieces of silver tree bark, which emanate with strange power. 

第二個筆記，明顯由一個未知的人匆忙寫下：
Note Two, is clearly scribbled in a hurry by an unknown author:

「精靈試圖阻礙我們的工作。這一點也不意外。我必須在他們搗亂之前找到這樹林。賢者之塔應該會給我一些阻止精靈的方法。黑暗不過是副作用，如果我讓人類再次被魔法統治，那才該死！」
‘The Elves seek to diminish our work. No surprise there. I must get to this Grove before they can meddle with Mankind again. The Sage Tower should give me some clues as to how to stop the Elves. The Darkness is a side effect for sure, but I’ll be damned if I let the magic rule Man again!’

剩下的筆記過於殘破，無法辨認。

第二個筆記，明顯是匆忙寫下的，是一個未知的不同作者。他暗示精靈不可信，人類應該掌握著自己的命運。裡面還提及到一座奇異的塔，它被標記在地圖上，寫著賢者之塔。
Note Two, is clearly scribbled in a hurry, by a different writer, unknown. It suggests that the Elves should not be trusted and that Mankind’s destiny should be their own. There is a mention of a very distinct tower, and you can actually see it marked on the map as well, as the Sage Tower.

As soon as you cross the line where the cat has run, you feel a blessing upon your group! 

那貓一定是一隻朵拉，一個友好的守護靈。
The cat must have been a Dola, a friendly, Guardian Demon.
<ANS>太好了。我們出發吧。
Great. Off we go then.

<PHASE>ID: 0
<STORY>你最終找到了地圖上的小樹林，儘管這裡只有一些石頭和塵土。但是在石群裡，生長著唯一一棵樹，翠綠而繁茂。
You finally find what must have been the grove from the map, although there is little left but some stones and dirt here. And yet, among the rubble, stands a single tree, still green and thriving, despite it all. 

當你靠近，那樹睜開了眼睛，盯著你！
When you approach, the tree opens its eyes and stares at you!
<ANS>「你好，我們在找很久以前可能經過這裡的精靈，他在尋求黑暗的起源。」
‘Hi there. We’re searching for an Elf that may have passed through here a long time ago, looking for answers to the Darkness.’
<ANS>「呃，你好，樹。」
‘Ehm, hello there tree.’
<ANS>一棵長有眼睛的樹！在它抓住你之前攻擊它！【戰鬥】
A tree with eyes! Attack it before it gets you!  [Fight]
<ANS>「我們又來了，樹！」
'We've come again Tree!'
<ANS>「你好。」
'Hello.'
<ANS>「好，我們帶著屍體回來了，正如你所要求的。」【撒謊】
'Right, we're back with the bodies, just as you’ve asked'  [Lie]
<ANS>「好，我們帶著你兄弟的屍體和餘下的族群回來了，現在交出精靈吧。」
'Right, we're back with the bodies of your brother and his flock, now give us the Elf.'

<PHASE>ID: 1
<STORY>那棵樹向你眨了眨眼，移動了下樹枝，就像換了個姿勢。慢慢地，它開口說道：
The tree blinks at you several times, before moving its branches around as if it was shifting in its place. Slowly, it begins talking:

「你說的精靈是什麼？你說的很久是多久，一個紀元？兩個？」
‘What is this Elf thing you speak of? And how long is ‘long ago’, an eon? Two?’
<ANS>「呃，好，精靈比較像人類，但有著尖耳朵，容貌秀美。很久是大約一百年。」
‘Ah, well, an Elf is kind of like a human but with pointy ears and real pretty and long ago was probably around a hundred years.’

<PHASE>ID: 2
<STORY>「我知道了，你指的是西婭的孩子們。肯定是非常年輕的傢伙。以前，樹林裡曾經有很多……」
‘I see, the Children of Thea you mean. Pretty young things to be sure. In the old days, there used to be many in my grove…’

那棵樹四周看了看，彷彿是第一次，你看到它的『臉』和它的眼睛變得更大：
The Tree looks around, as if for the first time, and you see its ‘face’ twisting and its eyes growing larger:

「我的樹林，我的樹林在哪裡！我的族群在哪裡！你對他們做了什麼？」
‘My grove, where is my grove! Where are all my charges! What have you done with them?’
<ANS>「嘿，冷靜，我們什麼都沒做。你的樹林一定是在無盡黑夜中死亡了！
‘Hey, calm down. We didn’t do anything. Your grove must have died during the Long Night!
<ANS>「冷靜。沒關係的。西婭已經被黑暗詛咒了一百年，你的樹林一定在這段時間腐朽了！」
‘Calm yourself. It is ok. Thea has been cursed with a hundred years of Darkness, your grove must have perished during that time!’

<PHASE>ID: 3
<STORY>「你們好，鮮活的孩子們。近一百年沒有來訪者了，如果不算想砍伐我的野獸的話。但從來沒有過善良，有知性的來訪者，從來沒有。」
‘Hello to you too, fleshy children. I haven’t had visitors in a while. Almost a hundred years, if you don’t count some beastly creatures trying to chop me down – but nice, cultured visitors, no, not for a time.’
<ANS>「很好，我們很高興認識你。實際上我們在找一隻精靈，他在這裡很久了，也許在尋找有關這黑暗的答案？」
‘Well, we’re glad to make your acquaintance. We’re actually looking for an Elf fella, he was here some time ago, perhaps looking for answers about the Darkness?’

<PHASE>ID: 5
<STORY>「哦，抱歉。是的，那是淒慘、冷酷的長夜。非常不愉快。不過，並不是由於無盡黑夜，而是我的兄弟，他偷走了我的族群。
‘Oh right, my apologies. Yes, that wretched, cold, Night. It was rather unpleasant. Still, it was not it. It was a brother of mine. He took my herd. 

嗯，這樣吧，我會告訴你所尋求的精靈下落，他試圖治癒我們，擺脫黑暗。但你必須殺了我的兄弟，然後把餘下的族群帶回來！」
Hmm. I tell you what. I will tell you all about the Elven child you speak off, the one seeking to cure us from Darkness, but only if you hunt down and kill my brother and bring me the remains of his flock!’
<ANS>「你的兄弟？」
‘Your brother?’
<ANS>「哦，不管怎樣，很好，我會殺了你要我殺的人，但是我怎麼知道你擁有我想要的信息？」
‘Oh whatever, fine, I will kill whomever you like, but how do I know you have the information I seek?’

<PHASE>ID: 6
<STORY>「你們這些鮮活的生物總是稱呼我們鹿首精，你說我們是惡魔，而我們得說那種描述值得慎重考慮。我們是森林守護者，是銀色母親的孩子，是牧人。我的兄弟與我相像，是鹿首精，但也是個卑鄙狡猾的傢伙！
‘You fleshy creatures oft call us Leshy, demons you say we are, and in all fairness, that description is wise. We are guardians of the forests, Sons of the Silver Mother, and shepherds. My brother is thus like me, a Leshy, but he is also a thieving wretch! 

他在我眼皮底下偷走了我的族群！他說我瘋了！瘋狂，而且被黑暗腐蝕！呸！只因為我和他思維不一致。我沒有去追殺黑暗生物。
He stole my flock from under me! Mad I am – he said! Mad and corrupted by the Dark! Bah! Only because I did not think as he did. I did not seek to kill the so called creatures of the Dark. 

啊，這沒有關係！重點是，我需要他的屍體和族群，這樣我才能重生這片森林！這是我的職責。」
Ah, no matter! What does matter, is that I need his wooden carcass and that of his flock, so that I may regrow this grove! And it is my business, why.’
<ANS>「好，但是我怎麼知道你擁有我想要的信息？」
‘Fine, but how do I know you even have the information I seek?’

‘I have what you seek right here.’

那樹發出辟啪的聲音，土壤搖動，樹根帶出了一個精靈，上面覆蓋著泥土，一動不動的，但他仍有呼吸！
The tree crackles, the earth beneath it shakes a bit and from the roots, it brings out an Elf. The Elf is covered in soil and motionless, but he still breathes!

「這年輕人也拒絕了我的好意！但我們看來陷入了僵局。我不會讓他死的，但我也不想放他走。可是，如果你按我說的做，我就給他自由！」
‘This young man refused my pleas also! But we seem to have reached an impasse. He will not die and yet I am not inclined to let him go. But, if you do the deed, I shall free him!’

<STORY>你遠離那棵樹。你一度以為它要攻擊你，但是相反地，它陷入了睡眠，似乎什麼都沒發生！
You step away from the tree and for a time, you think it is going to attack you, but instead, it falls into its slumber, as if nothing happened at all!

你可以強化後再來，或者晚點再和它談談。
You can come back with reinforcements, or speak to it again later.
<ANS>離開，重組隊伍，然後再回去找那棵樹。

‘Right. Get your brother and bring you his remains.'   Leave.

<PHASE>ID: 16
<STORY>你打敗了鹿首精和它的追隨者，當你砍倒它的時候，整棵樹都化成了銀色的粉末！
You defeat the Leshy and his followers and as you strike it down, the whole tree withers away into silver ash!

最後只剩下沉眠於灰燼之上的精靈！他仍有呼吸，但他看起來很虛弱，而且一根奇怪的銀線似乎通向他的心臟。
All that remains, is the sleeping figure of an Elf lying on a bed of ash! He still breathes, but he looks very weak and a strange, silver line seems to be making its way towards his heart.
<ANS>試著輕輕喚醒他。
Try to wake him gently.

Shake him up!

<PHASE>ID: 17
<STORY>「是的，幹得好，小傢伙。現在，就按我說的做，我已經對流浪者等得不耐煩了，他們總是讓人失望，而你確實奉獻了一場讓人滿意的戰鬥。
‘Yeah, nice try little saplings, now, just do my bidding. I am tired of waiting for stragglers, they always disappoint and you did put up a decent fight. 

一言以蔽之，我有你要的精靈，那個會修復西婭或者怎樣的精靈，而你有腿，可以去殺我的兄弟，把他的屍體帶回來。成交嗎？」
In a nutshell, I have your Elf, the one that will cure Thea or whatever, and you have legs so you can go hunt my brother and bring me back his corpse. Deal?’

Leave.

<STORY>精靈睜開了他的眼睛，說話小聲而清楚：
The Elf opens his eyes and speaks in but a whisper, yet his words are very clear:


「我沒有時間了，鹿首精復仇心切，他毒害我，確保假如他被殺了，我就會一起死。但是那不重要。
‘I have little time. The Leshy is vengeful, he poisoned me to ensure I perish if he is killed. But that is of no importance. 

那生物病入膏肓，也許殺了它才是最好的結果。現在，我知道你想尋求我任務的結果。我想你發現了我的筆記，因為如果你找到我的學生，她就會和你一起在這裡。這任務似乎壓垮了我們兩人。」
The creature was sick and perhaps it is best you freed Thea of him. Now, I know you seek answers to my quest. I assume you have discovered my notes, for if you found my student, she would be here with you. It seems this quest claimed us both.’
<ANS>「是的，恐怕我在精靈的屍體上找到了你的筆記。」
‘Yes, I am afraid we found your notes on an Elven body.’

<PHASE>ID: 21
<STORY>精靈只點了點頭：
The Elf only nods:

「這就是命運。也許是對未能守護秩序之樹的懲罰。西婭依然崩壞，但太陽已經歸來。這證明了一件事。秩序之樹的種子依舊存活！」
‘Such is fate. Perhaps it is punishment for our failure as guardians of the Cosmic Tree. I see the world is still corrupted, yet the sun has returned. This can mean only one thing. A seed of the Tree yet lives!’
<ANS>「什麼的什麼？」
‘A what, of the what?’
<ANS>「我聽說過秩序之樹，但知道的不多。」
'I know of the Cosmic Tree, but not much.'

<PHASE>ID: 22
<STORY>「好，你對於發生的事知道多少？」
‘Right. How much do you know of what happened?’
<ANS>「請直接說重點。」
‘Just give me the highlights please.’
<ANS>「我幾乎什麼都不知道。有棵樹，它被燒了，然後西婭也同樣陷入地獄。請告訴我全部來龍去脈。」
‘I know nearly nothing. There was a Tree, it burned and so did our Thea. Please tell me the whole story.’
<ANS>「實際上，我不喜歡聽故事。開門見山地說，我們現在要做什麼？」【跳過故事】
'Actually, I am not one for stories. Cut to the chase, what do we do now?'   [SKIP STORY]

<PHASE>ID: 23
<STORY>「嗯，你必須知道的是，秩序之樹是世界的支柱之一。大樹維持三界平衡，就是你們所說的神界——你們的諸神居住的地方，人界——凡人統治的地域，還有冥界——死者之地。
‘Well, what you must know is that the Cosmic Tree was one of the Pillars of the World. The Tree held the balance of three spheres, what you call the Divine – where your Gods dwell, the Earth, where mortals reign and the Underworlds, the domain of the dead. 

當秩序之樹燒燬，各界之間的門就會打開。諸神跌落神壇，失去力量和影響，死者湧向生者之地，無法安寧離世，西婭變成了荒蕪之地，不再適合凡人居住。」
When the Cosmic Tree burned, so did the gates between our worlds. Gods fell from their thrones, losing power and influence, the dead spilled out amongst the living, unable to cross over and find peace, and Thea became a barren land, unsuited for mortal life.’
<ANS>「這是怎麼發生的？」
‘How did it happen?’

<PHASE>ID: 24
<STORY>「我沒有充足時間告訴你全部，但我盡我所能。秩序之樹是世界七大支柱之一。其他存在於——也可能已經不存在——西婭遙遠的其他地區。每一支柱都有他們自己的故事。
‘We do not have so much time that I may tell you all, but I shall try my best. The Cosmic Tree was one of seven Pillars of the World. Others exist – or perhaps existed, in different, distant parts of Thea. Each with their own story. 

但是我們的大樹與我們息息相關。秩序之樹維持三界平衡，就是你們所說的神界——你們的諸神居住的地方，人界——凡人統治的地域，還有冥界——死者之地。
Our tree however, is what concerns us. The Cosmic Tree held the balance of three spheres: what you call the Divine – where your Gods dwell, the Earth, where mortals reign and the Underworlds, the domain of the dead.

<ANS>「這是怎麼發生的？」
‘How did it happen?’

<PHASE>ID: 25
<STORY>「西婭迎來人類時代，長者逐漸消失，人類得以迅速發展。但這遠遠不夠。人類沉迷力量，開始狩獵非人類。
‘An age of Man came to Thea, older peoples withdrew, to allow Man’s growth. But it was not enough. Man became obsesses with power and non-humans became his prey. 

但當所有城市都被洗劫一空，奴役所有人民後，人類卻慾壑難填。他們開始尋找七大支柱，我相信，他們認為七大支柱能帶給他們諸神之力。
But, once all the cities were looted and its people enslaved, Man sought out more, ever more. They came to seek the Seven Pillars, I believe, thinking they would grant divine power. 

當他們意識到七大支柱什麼都給不了的時候，他們便決定毀了它！」
When they realised the Seven Pillars give none, they destroyed them in spite!’
<ANS>「所以這都只是你的猜測？」
‘So this is all just your guess?’
<ANS>「這聽起來確實像人類所為。」
‘That does sound like humans alright.’
<ANS>「當這一切發生時，諸神在哪裡？為什麼秩序之樹沒有被保護起來？」
‘Where were the Gods when all this happened? Why wasn’t the Cosmic Tree protected?’
<ANS>「我聽過另一種說法，人類燒燬秩序之樹有其目的，而非洩憤。」
'I heard a different story, one where the humans burned the Cosmic Tree on purpose, rather than from spite.'

<PHASE>ID: 26
<STORY>「我不知道答案，但我會告訴你我的想法。曾有一段時期，我們稱之為人類時代，是偉大的人類諸王與戰勝邪惡的時代。
‘I know not the answer, but I will tell you what I think. There was a time we called the Age of Man, a time of great human queens and kings and victories over Evil. 

我們，精靈，決定離開故鄉，遠走西方，只留下少數來保護世界支柱。
We, the Elves, decided to sail away to our own lands, far into the west, leaving only a few to safeguard the Pillars of the World. 

但人類變得貪婪和嫉妒。在西境，非人類被屠殺，曾經高貴的諸王開始醉心於力量。他們掠奪了矮人的堡壘，奴役半身人為他們勞動，屠殺精靈以奪取知識。
But man grew greedy and jealous. In the Westerlands, non-humans were hunted and killed and kings and queens we once called noble, became obsessed with power. They looted Dwarven strongholds, enslaved Halfmen for their labour, and slaughtered Elfkin for our knowledge. 

我相信，出於貪婪，他們前往尋找七大支柱。當他們徒勞而返時，便決定毀了它！」
I believe, that in their greed, they came to seek out the Seven Pillars, and when they found no power to be had, they destroyed what they found!’

<STORY>「你們的諸神，是的。他們也是被指定的守護者，他們的職責就是維護平衡，所以我承認，我不知道發生了什麼事。
‘Your ‘Gods’, yes. They too were designated guardians and it was their duty to protect the balance, so I admit, I am amiss to what has happened. 

我們世界的規則禁止諸神采取直接行動，所以也許事情發生得太快。西境不崇拜你的諸神，也許這讓他們的力量更加減弱？我無法回答這個問題。」
The laws by which we live, prohibit the ‘Gods’ to act directly, so perhaps things transpired too quickly. And the Westerlanders do not worship your Gods, thus perhaps this lessened their power more? It is a question I cannot answer.’

‘Yes, sadly it does. Although, one should never judge a peoples as one mass and never give up on their future. 

我聽說西境精靈有些傲氣，孤獨和傲慢，但這只是對大多數而言，還是有些精靈選擇傾盡永生為別人服務，所以不能將其一概而論。」
I hear Westerner Elves have a reputation for being arrogant, detached and aloof and while I believe this to be a fair assessment for most, there are those who have committed their eternal lives to the service of others, so one cannot judge them same.’

‘An interesting question. For one, even I do not know where, or what all of the Pillars are. Each land has their own you see. 

但秩序之樹是一切的基礎。如果它被修復，西婭就能自行修復剩下的一切。
But the Cosmic Tree was the foundation of all. If it can be rebuilt, Thea will find a way to restore the rest. 

當然，如果你有機會發現其他支柱，或可選擇拯救那些支柱，請務必選擇那麼做！」

很久以前，男人和女人飛昇了，成為某種上位者，成為一種概念，一種希望。
Long ago, men and women rose up and ascended to become something more, to become an idea, a hope for their kind. 

這些勇敢的靈魂捨棄了肉身，成為你的守護神，你的保護者。於是他們成為神。不過不是我的神。僅此而已。」
These brave souls gave up their own mortal coils, to serve as your guardians, your protectors. And thus they became Gods. Just not mine. That’s all.’

魔法仍然存在，太陽已經返回，這意味著秩序之樹的種子在燃燒中存活了下來。它的新興力量為我們恢復了光，但它太虛弱了，不能自己茁壯成長。
The fact that magic still lingers and the sun has returned, means a seed of the Cosmic Tree has survived the burning. Its fledgling power restored the light to us, but it is too weak to thrive on its own. 

我們必須找到它，將它種植在神聖樹林中，在那裡，它將恢復全部力量，並恢復西婭過去的榮耀！」
We must find it and plant it in a sacred grove, where in time, it will grow to its full strength, and restore Thea to its former glory!’

‘Well, perhaps I am wrong. Let us not quibble on what they were. But focus on what they became. And on this we agree, they are your deities. 

有些精靈國家有自己的神。矮人相信大鍛冶師，我不知道半身人的神是什麼，也許是胡蘿蔔？重點是，我們都有我們的信仰。」
There are some Elven nations that have their own. The Dwarves believe in The Great Smith, I know not what the Halfmen peoples worship, carrots maybe? The point being, we all have our guides.’
<ANS>「那麼你的神呢？」
‘So who is yours?’
<ANS>「夠了，我們現在要對樹做什麼？」
‘Enough of this, what do we do now, about the Tree I mean?’

<PHASE>ID: 35
<STORY>「不，當然不。不然光之敵人可能會發現並銷毀它。因為你知道，如果這粒種子被燒燬了，他們的工作就完成了。各種意義上，西婭將不復存在。」
‘No, of course not. Else enemies of the Light may find it and finish what they started. For you see, if this seed burns, their job will be complete. In many ways, Thea will be no more.’

‘Yes, but, where do we find it?’

‘Rid Thea of magic! Preposterous! Do you realise how many lives will perish? Do you not have non-human friends? Do you not use magic? Haver you never asked a friendly demon for aid? All of it, all, will be gone. A memory, myth…’

The Elf looks really upset, but then he takes in a deep breath, looks up at the sky and then back at you. He looks much calmer:

「我想你是正確的。這是人類時代，可能更好，也可能更糟。我太弱了，不能直接干涉，所以我能做的就是接受你的決定。你知道後果，你有你的道路。帶著榮譽在你們的道路上前進吧。」
‘I suppose you are correct. It is the Age of Man, for better or, for worse. I am too weak to intervene, so all I can do is accept your decision. Whatever it may be. You know the consequences, you have your path laid out. Walk it with honour.’

‘… so yeah, we don’t know why these don’t feel special to you, but your brother is ashes, so our end of the bargain stands!’

鹿首精(Leshy)邊聽邊點頭：
The Leshy listens to you and nods:

「嗯，我沒有真的殺過其他鹿首精(Leshy)，誰知道黑暗對我們有何影響。樹的碎片都在這裡，所以它一定是真的。給，帶走精靈，離開我這裡。」
‘Well, I suppose I haven’t really killed a Leshy before, and who knows how this Darkness thing affects us. The Tree Shards are here, so it must be true. Here you go, take the Elf and leave me be, before I decide you’re good for compost!’

鹿首精(Leshy)再次變成一棵樹，木頭和碎片深埋入土。

But, just as the enraged Leshy was about to strike a final blow, he stops, freezes, looks at you with utter confusion;  ‘Oh Brother, you sneaky thing!’ – Then he turns into black ash before your very eyes!

一隻小松精——松果形狀的森林惡魔——說道：
A small Pineconnete – a forest Demon in the shape of a pine cone – remains behind:

「嗯，它的兄弟希望能不這麼做，但我們不能讓瘋樹阻礙母樹的復甦。即便用盡所有的生命力量我們也要保護母樹。祝你好運，人類！」
‘Well, his brother hoped this would not be necessary, but we could not let the mad tree stand in the way of reviving the Mother Tree, even if all of our life force were needed for this. Good luck to you humans!’

松精誇張地咳嗽，然後倒在地上也變成灰燼。
The Pineconnete coughs a few times in a rather theatrical manner, then it collapses on the ground and also turns to ash.

‘I am still weak and it will take much time for me to recover, but thanks to you, I shall. But that is of no importance. Let us leave this place and talk of the fate of Thea.  

我聽到了你和鹿首精的談話，我知道你想尋求我任務的結果。我想你發現了我的筆記，因為如果你找到我的學生，她就會和你一起在這裡。這任務似乎壓垮了我們兩人。」
Now, I heard your talk with the Leshy, I know you seek answers to my quest. I assume you have discovered my notes, for if you found my student, she would be here with you. It seems this quest claimed us both.’

「啊，抱歉。緊張時我會有點焦躁。我叫提爾達，後面是我的有些獨特的部落。我們關注著你們有關秩序之樹種子的進展。」
‘Eh, sorry. I get a bit snarky when I’m nervous. The name’s Tilda, and back there you have my rather unique tribe. We were watching your progress in regards to the Cosmic Tree Seed.’
<ANS>「你怎麼知道這件事？」
‘How do you know about that?’
<ANS>「這不關你的事！」
‘It’s none of your business!’

<STORY>「嗯，你正在做一件大事，傳言四起。尤其如果你知道哪裡可以獲得情報的話。
‘Well, what you’re doing is the big stuff, and word gets around. Especially if you know where to listen. 

我們的森林親族聽說了你在年老瘋狂的鹿首精森林引發的騷動了，而我們監視這個地方也有段時間了，然後你們來了。」
Our forest kinsfolk heard the ruckus you caused in the old, mad Leshy’s grove, and then we’ve been watching this here place for a time, and here you are.’
<ANS>「你還沒有告訴我為什麼？你對什麼感興趣？」
‘You still haven’t told me why? What’s your interest here?’

<PHASE>ID: 3
<STORY>「我不健談，所以我將盡可能簡潔扼要。我們知道你和精靈交談過，還可能和老人在塔裡交談過。所以，你知道，不管怎麼說，你們人類計劃，或造成了秩序之樹被焚燬？」
‘I’m not a talker, so I’ll try to be brief and to the point. You spoke to the Elf, we know that, perhaps you spoke to the elderly human in the tower. So, you know that one way or another, you humans devised, or caused the burning of the Cosmic Tree?’
<ANS>「是的，似乎確實如此。」
‘Yes, that seems to be the consensus.’
<ANS>「是的，這就是精靈告訴我們的。」
‘Yes, that’s what the Elf told us.’

<PHASE>ID: 4
<STORY>「嗯。是的，我不關心哪個版本是真的，我只關心秩序之樹還存在著。」
‘Mhm. Yeah, I don’t really care which version is true, but I do care that the Tree remains as it is now.’
<ANS>「什麼？」
‘What?’
<ANS>「不出意料，黑暗生物想要邪惡永存！」
‘As expected, the creatures of Darkness wanting the Evil to stay!’

<PHASE>ID: 5
<STORY>「唔。我們很容易找借口說因為我們被迫服務西境的黑暗之王，所以我們尋求邪惡的部分統治。但是，事實並非如此。
‘Hmm. It would be easy to say that because we were made to serve Dark Lords of the Westerlands, we now seek some evil dominion. But, it is not so. 

我們不是邪惡的，至少不比其他生物更邪惡。如果你要毀滅秩序之樹，你知道有數以百萬計的生命將會丟失嗎？或者你讓秩序之樹再次生長，我們將會被捕獵，被指責，被消滅，就像往常一樣。
We are not evil, at least not more so than any creature trying to live and survive. Do you know how many millions of lives will be lost if you were to destroy the Cosmic Tree? Or even if you regrow it, we will be hunted, picked on and killed off, just like always. 

我們不追求殺戮、征服或統治你們，只是為了和平生活。」
We do not seek to murder or enslave, or take power, just to live in peace.’
<ANS>「說的好聽，但你說了你想要保留黑暗，對嗎？」
‘Nice words, but you just said you want the Darkness to remain, right?’

<PHASE>ID: 6
<STORY>「是的，我說了。但不是因為它是邪惡。它不是，呃，它算是邪惡的副產物，我承認這點。我們掙扎了數百年，差不多滅絕了。
‘Yes, I did. But not because it is Evil. It is not, well, ok, it has evil side effects, I grant you that. We’ve all struggled during the hundred years, we’ve all been close to extinction. 

但是，最終，我們成功創造了新的平衡。太陽歸來了，但沒有恢復全部力量。秩序之樹還活著，至少某種意義上如此，所以我們有魔法，因此我們繼續生存，但生存在新的世界。」
But, finally, we managed to create a balance of sorts. The sun is back, but not in its full strength. The Tree is alive, sort of, so we have magic, and thus we live on, but in a new world.’
<ANS>「你說你成功創造了新的平衡？」
‘You say you managed to achieve a balance?’

<PHASE>ID: 7
<STORY>「是的，正是我們，所謂的黑暗生物，保存了秩序之樹最後的種子。借此，我們救了自己，和所有魔法。
‘Yes, it was us, the so-called creatures of Darkness that saved the last seed of the Tree. In doing so, we saved ourselves, and all that is magical. 

但是，我們沒有把它還給精靈或諸神，他們總試圖支配我們。在這個灰色地帶，我們最終得到了自由。」
Yet, we do not have to give power back to the Elves and high Lords and Ladies who forever seek to dominate us. In this grey area, we are finally free.’
<ANS>「你們既然有種子，為什麼擔心我們？很明顯你不覺得我們能用武力奪走它？」
‘So if you have the seed, why worry about me? Surely you do not think I can defeat you all to get it?’
<ANS>「看，這聽起來很偉大，但是說實話，我們是太陽神斯瓦洛格的孩子，你知道嗎？無論你話中有何等智慧，我們決不會拋棄太陽！」
‘Look, it all sounds grand, but truth be told, we are children of Svarog, the Sun God, you know? Whatever wisdom may lay within your words, we will never forsake the sun!’
<ANS>「傻瓜，我們是太陽神的孩子！你無法阻擋光芒之道！要麼滾開，要麼面對我們神的憤怒！」
‘We are the children of the Sun God you fools! You will not stand in the way of light! Now stand aside or face our God’s wrath!’
<ANS>「我們的母親莫科史為西婭而哭泣，你還試圖讓西婭維持現狀？絕不！」
‘Our Mother Mokosh weeps at the state of her beloved Thea, and you seek to keep it as it is? Never!’
<ANS>「莫科史母神是和藹關懷我們的母親，但是你用骯髒的黑暗和詛咒污染了她的西婭，不死生物四處遊蕩。她將不會容忍這一切。絕不！」
‘Mother Mokosh is a kind and caring parent, but you have soiled her Thea with filthy Darkness, curses, and the undead roaming everywhere. She will not stand for it. Ever!’

‘We do not underestimate the drive and power humans hold. We’ve watched your progress and we know you could try. But, that is not our worry. Alas, the seed proved to have a mind of its own as it were. 

我們剛取得它，它就立刻消失了。我們不知道它在哪兒，
It disappeared from our charge as fast as it first came into our possession. We know not where it is now. 

我想只有守護者知道。我知道你已經得到了種子位置的標記。」

精靈將會找到其他人完成任務。不，我希望你加入我們，找到種子並安全保存它。
The Elves will seek out another. No, we want you to join us, to find the seed and to keep it safe with you. 

你看，人類是最具有適應性的生物。當然，你需要去適應，沒有足夠太陽的生活不那麼輕鬆。
You see, humans are the most adaptable among all of us. Sure, you will need to adjust, life without much sun, will not be easy. 

但是，我們可以一起建造某些更強大的事物。不依賴精靈，而是魔法！」
But, together, we can build something stronger. Without the Elves, but with magic!’
<ANS>「我不確定。一旦我得到了種子，我會考慮你的提議。」
‘I am not sure about all of this. I will consider your offer, once I have the seed.’

You find your way back to the Elven Guardian, Alysir, and discover him sitting on a rock, meditating. He still looks very weak, but as you walk towards him, he wakes and looks at you:

「所以你得到了我們需要的東西了嗎？」
‘So, you have what we need?’
<ANS>「是的，但我們有一些問題要問你。」
‘Yes, but we have some questions for you.’

<ANS>「好吧。」給他碎片。
‘Alright.’ Give him the shards.

<PHASE>ID: 2
<STORY>艾力斯爾伸出手，拿取你遞出的碎片。他將碎片緊握在掌心，開始唱歌。
Alysir stretches out his arms for you to hand him the shards. When you do, he closes them in his palms and begins to sing. 

你聽不懂他的語言，但是他的聲音如風中低語般柔和，每個字都像花瓣輕拂過肌膚，飄揚的旋律宛如家中烘烤的麵包般香甜，讓你回憶起母親的笑容。
You do not understand the language, but his voice is soft as a whisper on the wind, each word feels like a flower petal gently caressing your skin and the melody carries in the air like a sweet smell of home baked cakes, or your mother’s smile. 

歌聲停止，你感到靈魂充滿喜悅。你看到艾力斯爾手中的銀橡果。橡果頂部發出了藍色光芒，無論你如何移動，它都指向同一個方位。
When the song stops, you feel your souls lifted with joy and you see a silver acorn in Alysir’s hands. The acorn has a blue light on its top and it points in one direction, wherever you move it.
<ANS>「所以，這會引領我們找到種子？」

<STORY>「好了，你的問題是什麼？」
'Ok, so what is your question?'
<ANS>「我們遇到一些非人類的生物，準確地說，是一個希望黑暗維持現狀的團體。既不是完全的黑暗，也不是過去的光明。」
‘We were approached by some non-humans, or rather, by a group of creatures who wish for the Darkness to remain as it is now, neither fully dark, nor back to the way it was.’

<PHASE>ID: 11
<STORY>「有趣？以西婭之名，為什麼他們要這麼做？」
‘Interesting? And why on Thea would they do this?’
<ANS>「為了擺脫魔法，邁入理性與知識的時代，人類再也不會迷信。」
‘To rid the world of magic and thus bring about an age of reason and knowledge, where Humans are no longer bound by superstition.’
<ANS>「呃，我好像問過這個問題了，還是問點別的吧。」
'Eh, I think I already asked you about this, let's just get back to the other questions.'

<PHASE>ID: 12
<STORY>精靈皺眉道：
The Elf frowns:

「讓西婭擺脫魔法！荒謬！你意識到有多少生命會滅亡嗎？你沒有非人類的朋友嗎？你不使用魔法嗎？你沒有向友善的惡魔求助過嗎？
‘Rid Thea of Magic! Preposterous! Do you realise how many lives will perish? Do you not have non-human friends? Do you not use magic? Have you never asked a friendly Demon for aid? 

這一切都會消失。成為回憶，神話……」
All of it, all, will be gone. A memory, myth…’
<ANS>「嗯，我想你是對的。讓我們回到其他問題上。」
‘Yeah, I suppose you’re right. Let us get back to the other questions.'
<ANS>「是的，沒錯，但這一定會讓西婭變糟嗎？我的意思是，這確實意味著你們的末日，但你不是說要給我們自由，讓我們掌控西婭嗎？」
‘Yes, you’re right, but are you sure it is all bad? I mean, I know it means the end of your people, but didn’t you say you wanted to give us the freedom, to leave Thea in our charge?’

<PHASE>ID: 13
<STORY>「好吧，我們確實這麼做了，但看看發生了什麼！首先你們獵殺並奴役任何異族，然後策劃摧毀魔法！
‘Well, we did, but look what happened! First you hunt down and enslave anything that is different from you, then you hatch a plan to destroy Magic! 

當然不是你，而是那些人，來自所謂的學府。呸！你肯定不會這麼想吧？」
Not you, of course, but those men and women, from that so-called University. Bah! Surely you are not considering it?’
<ANS>「不，不會。至少現在不會。」
'No, not really. At least not for now.'

<ANS>「好吧，但我要問你有關賢者塔的問題。」
‘Aright, but I need to ask you about the Sage tower and what I found out there.’
<ANS>「我們遇到一些夜之生物，向我們提出了建議。」
‘We met some creatures of the night, who had a proposal for us.’
<ANS>「我很抱歉，但是我們不會遵從你的道路。你看，我們花大量時間仔細思考了這個問題，我們覺得唯有變革才能進步。我們不能滯留在過去，不應該只是墨守成規。那太不自然了。莫樂娜教導我們，命運之輪必須前進。我們將擁抱未來，而不是過去！」
‘I am sorry to do this, but we won’t follow your path. You see, we had much time to think this over, and we decided that change is the only way forward. We must not look back to the past, we mustn’t try to recreate what was there. That would be unnatural. The wheel of fate must turn, as Morena teaches us. We will embrace the future now, and not the past!’
<ANS>「作為佐婭，多面的女神和野獸的守衛，的勇士，我們不能允許秩序之樹的再生。那將會使她被野獸之鏈束縛，被先輩控制。但如果我們選擇另一條道路，她將會被解放！」
‘As the champions of Zorya, the many faced Goddess and guardian of the beast, we cannot permit for the rebirth of the Cosmic Tree. Such a fate would enslave our Lady to the chains of the beast and the control of her elders once more, but if we choose another path, she too will be free!’

‘Yes, this will lead you. I would go myself, but you see how much strength this has cost me. So, it is up to you now. 

注意，羅盤已經做好了，我感到有一種強大的力量存在於它所指的方向。出發前做好充分準備，去面對任何可能出現在你面前的事物。」
Beware, now that the compass is made, I feel a great power resides in the direction it points to. Make sure you’re ready to face whatever hides at your journey’s end before you go.’

你肯定不會讓西婭陷入如此命運吧？」
Surely you are not considering such a fate for Thea?’
<ANS>「呃，他們說的有道理。他們說所有的生物和大地自身都會適應並進化，更加包容夜之生物。我不太確定……」
‘Well, they made some sense. They said that all creatures and the land would adjust and change into something new. Something that is perhaps more inclusive of their needs. I don’t know…’
<ANS>「對，你說得對，這聽上去就像奪權的技倆。我們會戒備他們的。」

守護者在你面前閉上了眼睛，慢慢變成了玻璃一般的雕像，平靜而美麗，沒有被詛咒，彷彿只是入睡了。
The Guardian closes his eyes and before you, he slowly turns into a glass-like statue, serene and beautiful, untouched by the curse as if he were merely asleep.

三頭龍開始生長，向天空伸展。牠的身體變成深黑色，你看見牠吞下了小小的銀色種子。三頭龍的身體變成了黑曜石般的塔，塔頂是一個蛇頭。塔隨著黑暗能量悸動，你看到黑霧和悲泣怨靈從蛇口慢慢逃向天空……
The Zmey begins to grow, and as he does, he unwinds towards the sky. His body becomes pitch black and you see him swallowing a small, silver seed. The body of the Zmey freezes into a black, obsidian tower, with a snake’s head at the top. The tower pulsates with dark energy, and you see slowly the Black Mist and Wailing Wraiths escaping through the snake’s mouth into the sky…

然後，一切都消失了，你再次看到樹樁上的三頭龍，牠在大笑！

You finish the ritual and just like the Zmey said, the Seed is absorbed into the Tree’s stump. Immediately, you see life return to the ancient wood and a single, thin, long, branch reaches out, with a tiny green leaf, delicately rustling in the wind.

<ANS>「好的，所以我需要強化村莊和住民，我該如何著手？」
‘Ok, so I need to improve our village and people, so how do I get started?’

<PHASE>ID: 4
<STORY>「首先，探索你的村莊，點擊物品欄查看你的物品，然後讓村民去收集食物和燃料（比如木頭）。 
‘First, go and explore your VILLAGE, check the INVENTORY to see your stocks, and set people to GATHER Food and Fuel (like wood). 

沒有食物，村民會挨餓；沒有燃料，就無法製作道具甚至治療，所以這些非常重要。」
Without food, people will starve and without fuel, they will not CRAFT or even HEAL, so these are really important.’

Select your Party and send them to me.

我會在村外等你們。（我在地圖上標記了一個巨大的藍色問號，所以他們會看到我在哪兒！）

EVENTS, such as meeting me, will occur throughout your adventures. 

有些是隨機事件，有些是必然事件，而且多種多樣。
Sometimes they are random, sometimes predestined and always varied.

探索時會發生事件，大地圖會有事件，村莊中也會發生時間——所以請記住，村莊無人照料是件相當危險的事！」
Events can occur when you’re out exploring, but also globally, or within your village – so remember, leaving your settlement unattended may be dangerous!’
<ANS>「好的，事件隨時隨地會發生。還有別的事嗎？」
‘Right. Events can occur at any time, both within the village and out in the world. Anything else?’

<STORY>「非常好，做得漂亮！記得儲存你的資源，它們可能會在某一天派上用場！
‘Wonderful. Well done! And keep your resources, they may come in handy on a rainy day you know! 

正如你看到的，你在獲得材料時，同時也會獲得經驗值與研究點數。所有這些都會使你變得更強。」
As you saw, you got both Experience points and Research points, on top of any material Rewards. All of these will help you grow stronger.’
<ANS>「好的，我們通過進行任務獲得經驗值與研究點數，同時也會獲得報酬獎勵，然後呢？」
‘Oh ok, so we gain Experience and Research by doing such tasks, and we can get Rewards, so what now?’

<PHASE>ID: 3
<STORY>「許多事件要求您攜帶特定物品或完成特定事物來推動劇情。
‘Many events will ask you to bring stuff, or do things in order to move to the next stage. 

我之前請求您在村莊中收集食物與燃料。所以，您可以在村莊中收集資源，但也可以通過在您探索中的地方設置營地來獲取。」
I asked you before to Gather Food and Fuel in your Village. So, you can GATHER resources, in your village, but also, by setting up a camp when you’re out exploring.'
 
（想要設置營地，站在空的六邊形單元格上並在迷你列表中選擇帳篷標誌）

<PHASE>ID: 8
<STORY>「所以，你應該已經發現了，有些事件將會讓你通過戰鬥以外的其他手段來解決一些情況。
'So, you’ve also discovered that some Events will let you solve a situation through more than combat.

這些非戰鬥的挑戰常常和戰鬥一樣困難，但它意味著戰鬥並非唯一手段！
These non-combat CHALLENGES are often just as hard, but it means that fighting is not the only way!

記住，戰鬥中受到的傷害可以導致村民死亡，即使是在戰鬥結束後。所以選擇其他手段通常更安全！同樣的，隊伍中有一名醫師也會減小死亡概率！
Remember, WOUNDS from Combat Challenges can kill your people, even after the fight, so choosing a different path is often safer! And having a Medic in your party will help decrease the chances of dying as well!

總之，野豬那事，幹的漂亮！」
Anyway, great job on the boars!’
<ANS>「謝了，但還是不太懂挑戰，能講講基本規則嗎？」

總之，這是遠超金子的原則性問題。你留著金子吧，也許你會需要它製作更好的東西。」
Anyway, it’s a matter of principles rather than the gold itself, so just keep it, you may need it to craft better stuff, you know.'

‘Thanks. So what now?’

<PHASE>ID: 10
<STORY>「現在，您應該注意到了，一些裝備和村莊建築物需要大量材料，通常是不太容易收集到的。
'Now, you will notice that some EQUIPMENT as well as BUILDINGS in your VILLAGE, require a lot of stuff, often things that are not easily gathered, or commonly found. 

因此，我建議您探索地圖，尋找廢墟，廢棄隧道，遠古之塔——你明白我的意思，對吧？
For such needs, I also recommend scouring the world map in search of old ruins, abandoned tunnels, ancient towers – you get the gist, right?

剛好我知道一個你可以去探索的古老地牢！
It so happens that I know of an old dungeon that you can explore and loot! 

我已經將這個地點標記在你的地圖上了。」
I have marked this place on your map.’
<ANS>「謝了，所以稀有材料可以通過事件與特殊地點獲取。還有什麼我可以帶給你的嗎？」

<STORY>「太棒了！也許您已經注意到了，地牢有許多不同路線可以探索，如果你缺乏某些技能，部分地區還會被隱藏。舉例而言，魔法師和瞭解鄉野民俗的人經常發現更多信息或提供額外選擇。
Excellent stuff! Perhaps you noticed how the dungeon had many routes to explore, and some may still be obscured for you if you lack certain skills. MAGIC users and those who know FOLKLORE for example, often find themselves finding more information, or alternative options. 

其他技能同樣如此！所以確保派遣不同的隊伍去外面的世界，因為你從不知道你需要什麼技能！
But the same goes for all the skills really! So make sure to send diverse teams out into the world, as you never quite know what you might need!

我感覺你已經準備好獨自在西婭生存了！再見，願您為西婭帶來繁榮！

<STORY>「交涉挑戰中，如你所見，您將面對您的對手，但不同的技能組合也會有所關聯，比如口才，吸引力與意志力。所以記住，不同挑戰用不同技能，隊伍才能在探索中對世界產生影響。
‘In social challenges, as you saw, you will face your opponent, but different skill sets become relevant, such as Speech, Attractiveness and Will. So just remember, different challenges, use different skills and so your party composition can have a great impact on the way you explore the world.

你可能注意到了，您也會獲得研究點數就像獲得經驗值那樣。
As you perhaps noticed, you got Research points as well as XP. 


你需要研究點數來研發新材料，製造圖紙和村莊的新建築！」
You need Research Points to discover new Materials and Recipes for CRAFTING and new Buildings for your Village!’

'Sure. Firstly, you can always ask me for my tips again (reset the tutorial in the Help menu).

但是，先說明一些核心提示：
But, just to give you some of the core tips:

起始選項是在每次挑戰開始時隨機生成的，你沒法掌控這個。
Initiative is randomly rolled at the start of each challenge, so you have no control over this.

您的隊伍被分為兩個部分，戰術與進攻，同樣，這也是隨機分配的。
Your party is split into two hands, tactical and offensive and again, this is done randomly. 

雙方卡片「進攻」最近的敵人，戰局在桌面上從左到右開始。
Cards 'attack' their closest enemy on either side and the round begins from left to right of the table.

有許多種技能與武器可以提供特殊的戰術與進攻能力。
There are various skills and weapon types that give you special tactical and offensive capabilities.

這只是一部分指示，在幫助中可以查看更多詳細信息！」

我看到了一個惡魔，叫霍立克，我想讓你去說服他給你些金子。拿到金子後，帶著金子回到這裡！」
I spotted a fellow Demon, called Hohlick, and I want you to convince him to give you some gold. When you have it, bring it back here!'

或者，也可以選擇搏鬥！這可不輕鬆！
Or, better yet, you can go all ‘native’ on these beasties and wrestle them to the ground! Not an easy option that one!

You approach the Slavers and see they are a mixed group of different peoples, including Orcs, Humans, Goblins and even Dwarves. They drag behind them a row of malnourished, worn out slaves, including children, shackled and cruelly whipped by their captors.

<STORY>你一路追蹤惡棍布蓋，發現他和一些長有雙翼的女人——很可能是風之小惡魔——在一起，還有維栗和很多大小各異的松精，其中有長著人臉的松果，蘑菇，栗子和行走的樹枝人。
You chase down the rogue Bugay and find him in the company of some winged women, most likely the wind Demonettes, Vily, and several Pineconnetes of various shapes and sizes, including pine cones, mushrooms, chestnuts or walking twigs with human-like faces. 

這個奇怪的隊伍攜帶著一些盆栽和幼小的樹苗。他們還帶著柳條編成的大籃子，滲出些許暗紅色，散發出鐵銹的味道。
This strange menagerie is carrying with it some potted plants and young tree saplings. They also have a large wicker basket, with a dark red tinge to it, and a metallic smell.

布蓋，一個長滿鬍子，以樹枝為發，以樹皮為膚的老頭，開口說道：
The Bugay, in the form of an older, bearded man, with twigs for hair and tree bark for skin, speaks up:

「你要做什麼，鮮嫩的小傢伙？」
‘What do you want from us, fleshy creature?’
<ANS>「好吧，坦白說，你的前上司，一個有點嚇人的鹿首精，要我們殺了你。」
‘Well, to be frank, your former boss, a rather scary Leshy, asked us to kill you.’
<ANS>「喔，沒什麼，只是看到你出現，就好奇你要做什麼。我沒有看到森林，但你卻在這兒。」
‘Oh nothing, just noticed your presence and wondering what you’re up to. I see no forest here, yet here you are.’
<ANS>「一位古老的鹿首精好像擔憂你的心智，並請我們跟你談談。」
'An old Leshy seemed rather concerned with your sanity, and asked us to deal with it.'

‘Curious little fleshy you are eh? You know, I heard this saying of yours about a cat dying from this affliction…’
<ANS>「不必暴躁！我們只想知道你是誰。」
‘No need to get testy! We just wanted to see who you are.’
<ANS>「啊，再這麼說話，就讓我們看看貓有沒有爪子！」
‘Yeah, talk like this more, and find out if the cat has claws!’

<PHASE>ID: 2
<STORY>「啊，那個老樹樁，派遣小生物追殺我們。呸！好像你能殺得了我們一樣！」
‘Ah, the old stump, sending fleshy minions after us. Bah! As if you could slay us!’
<ANS>「不必趾高氣昂。我們當然能，但也許我們可以談談？」
‘No need to get on your high horse. We could, but perhaps we can talk instead?’
<ANS>「那就來試試吧！」
‘You wanna try and find out if we can!’

You have defeated the Bugay and his minions! You find their bodies disintegrate into various wood types. Among the rubble, you find one, lone Pineconette looking up at you:

「嗨，我不知道你注意到沒有，但我一直藏在這裡，沒有攻擊你們。我被這些瘋子們糾纏了幾年了，請帶上我吧！」
‘Hi, I don’t know if you noticed, but I hid all the way through, and I didn’t fight you. I’ve been stuck with these madmen for years, please take me with you!’
<ANS>「好吧，跟我們來吧。」
‘Oh ok, come with us.’
<ANS>「不！」殺了它！

‘We have found a way to live free of any forest, to gain power from another… life-force.’

所有惡魔都好笑地看向你，你感覺一陣惡寒爬上脊髓。
You feel a chill run down your spine as all the Demons looks at you kind of funny.

現在想想，那個柳條籃子確實大到足夠裝下幾個人了……
Now you think about it, the wicker basket is kind of big enough for several humanoids…
<ANS>「嗯，另一個生命之力？鹿首精因此才不喜歡你的吧？」
‘Ehm, another life-force you say? Is this why the Leshy dislikes you so?’
<ANS>「所以，願意分享你的秘密嗎？」
‘So, care to share your secret?’

<PHASE>ID: 8
<STORY>「是的，你的恐懼是正確的。我們現在靠吸食如你這般的血肉為生，這也是為什麼鹿首精稱我們為可憎之物。
‘Yes, you are correct in your fears. We now feed on the flesh and blood of such as yourselves and this is why the Leshy calls us abominations. 

但是，別忙著拔出你的"乾草叉"。我們並不需要經常進食，一年只需要兩三個人或亞人，更多地吸食會使我們獲得額外力量……」
But, before you get your pitchforks out. We do not need to do this often, a couple of humanoids per year keep us steady, a few more give us extra power…’
<ANS>「那你們為什麼沒有大開殺戒，以獲取真正的力量？！」
‘So what’s to stop you from killing hundreds, to have real power?!’
<ANS>「這並不能讓我們舒服些！」
‘This does not make us feel better you know!’

<PHASE>ID: 9
<STORY>「當然，我們可以通過屠殺來獲得更強的力量，但是，我們並不傻。西婭羸弱而磕磕絆絆，我們不能耗盡食物來源。
‘Well, sure, we could go on a rampage and gain even more power, but, we’re just not stupid. Thea is weak and stumbling, we cannot deplete our food source. 

看，我們不是嗜血的惡魔！我們只取需要的量，並且我們只吸食虛弱的垂死之人，或是主動招惹我們的人！」
Look, we’re not bloodthirsty fiends! We only take as much as we need and we try to only go for those we find already weak and dying, or those who attack us first!’
<ANS>「這真是太離譜了，鹿首精是對的，你們必須死！」
‘Well this is outrageous! The Leshy was right, you must die!’
<ANS>「好吧，我們陷入了困境。你承認了你吃過我們的同族。所以你看，我們很難就這麼放過這事。」
‘Ok, now we have us a pickle here. You just admitted you eat our kind. So you see, it is kind of hard for us to let that one go.’

<PHASE>ID: 10
<STORY>「啊，是的。也許我太樂觀了。我不習慣和你們交流。好吧，我們可以開打，或者，你可以離開。」
‘Ah, yes. Perhaps I was too forthcoming. I am not used to talking to you people. Well, we can fight. Or, you can just leave.’
<ANS>「恐怕你們還是太危險了！」進攻！【戰鬥】
‘I am afraid you’re too much of a danger!’ Attack!  [Fight]
<ANS>「好吧，我們這就離開。」離開。
‘Yeah, we’re just gonna go.’ Leave.
<ANS>「不如我們做個約定？你發誓再也不攻擊我們並做出一些補償，我們就不管你們？」【交涉】
‘How about we make some kind of deal eh? You swear never to attack our people and sweeten the deal, and we leave you be?’  [Social]

<STORY>「好吧，你們看起來比我們武裝更精良，而且有不少人。我不喜歡惹上麻煩。
‘Well, you do look better equipped than we like, and there are a few of you here. I do not like the trouble this could bring. 

我們可以留下一位松精，反正她渴望離開我們很久了，她不喜歡血祭儀式，多麼多愁善感的小傢伙。
We will leave you one of our Pineconnetes, she’s been keen to leave our company anyway, doesn’t like the blood rituals, sensitive little fella she is. 

我們還將提供些稀有木材，之後就會離開你的村莊。但是，記住，一旦我們再次相遇，那將是不死不休！」
And we shall throw in some rare wood. We will then move away from your village. But, beware, if we meet again, we will face each other!’

但今夜，休迪真的出現在了你面前！
But this night, the Dziody actually appear before you!

一個年長的，長滿鬍鬚的人用低沉刺耳的聲音說：
One, an elder, bearded man, speaks with a heavy, coarse voice:

「你們讓我們無比榮耀，孩子們。現在我們會淨化你們身上的一切詛咒！
‘You have done us proud, grandchildren. Now we shall cleanse you of any curses you carry! 

如果你們的靈魂再次被骯髒的黑魔法污染，就去我們曾稱之為家的城市，找出我們。如果你們能證明自己的價值，你們就能得到再一次淨化的機會。」
And if your souls are ever burdened by the filth of dark magic, come to a city we once called home, seek us out, and if you prove yourselves worthy, you may be cleansed once more.’

休迪一致點頭同意，然後消失了……

Another speaks up:

「他們尋求幫助，但要遵守規矩。
我們需求食物，方能提供幫助。」
‘They come for aid but rules have to be laid.
 We take our food that will change our mood.’

一個柳條編成的籃子出現在了你面前，你明白除非你給【50食物】否則這些先祖不會和你說話。
A wicker basket appears before you and you know these forefathers will not speak to you more unless you feed them [50 food].
<ANS>「好了，你說當我們被詛咒的時候我可以來這裡？」【給50食物】
‘Ok, so you said I could come here if we become cursed?’   [Give 50 food]

‘You seek our aid, and guidance you shall receive. For each dark curse has its own flavour, and so the relief lies in different realms. You will face a challenge our child, and if you pass you shall be cleansed!’

如果你們被邪惡力量詛咒變形，你們將需要潛行接近水澤女妖，偷走她的一束頭髮，然後我們可以為你們解除詛咒。
If you have been Deformed by evil forces, you will sneak up to a water nymph, and steal a strand of her hair, we can then lift the curse for you.

如果你們受到直接的黑暗詛咒，你們需要獵殺一隻拜厄斯，而一旦你們殺死了他，我們就能將黑暗從你們轉移給他。無須擔心，如果你們失敗了，我們將保護你們免遭他的攻擊。」
And if you have been cursed by the Darkness itself, you will hunt down a Bies and once you have him we will transfer the Darkness away from you and into the beast, don’t worry, we will shield you from his attacks if you fail.’

記得，治療傷口我要收取食物【30單位】和木材【5單位】，你還得額外幫我一個忙。但我得先警告你，即使你沒能幫上忙，我也會取走食物和木材！
Beware, for healing wounds I require food [30] and wood [5 pieces] as payment, as well as a favour, but, I am warning you, even if you fail the favour, I still take the goods!

You come across a small lake. 

當你靠近水邊的時候，你看到了一個小女孩。她抱膝而坐，靜靜地哭泣。
As you approach the water, you are met by a young girl, softly weeping as she sits cradling her knees. 

她仰頭看著你們，害怕得瑟瑟發抖。她那閃耀著光澤的長髮和她身上已經破舊的上等衣物都濕透了。
She looks up at the party and cowers in fear. Her long lustrous hair and her ragged, yet strangely fine clothes, are drenched.
<ANS>「嘿，那邊的，你還好嗎？」
'Hello there? Are you ok?'
<ANS>攻擊這個女孩。詭異的哭泣小女孩都是邪惡的！

<PHASE>ID: 1
<STORY>女孩看著你，雙眼因哭泣而紅腫充血。她的聲音顫抖，但不可思議地非常柔和而富有韻律，彷彿在耳邊輕唱：
The girl looks at you, her eyes bloodshot from crying, her voice shaky, yet unbelievably melodic and soft, as if a song were whispered into your ears:

「哦，陌生人，你是來幫助我的，對嗎？我迷路了，還被搶走了身上攜帶的水果。我必須拿回水果，不然我的姐姐們一定會將我從她們之中放逐的！哦，請一定要幫助我！」
‘Oh strangers, you come here to help me, yes? I have strayed and I was robbed of the fruit I carried. I must have it back, else my sisters will surely banish me from their graces! Oh please help!’
<ANS>給陌生人食物，只因為她姐姐們會生氣。智障才這麼做！「我很抱歉，小姐，但我毫不關心你丟失的水果。我的人民都沒有足夠的水果。我不能幫助你。」
Give a stranger food, because her sisters will be angry, yeah right! ‘I am sorry miss, but lost fruit is none of my concern, there is little enough for my own people. I cannot help you.’
<ANS>呃，這女孩看上去確實很傷心，而你對哭泣的女人毫無抵抗力。「好吧，好吧，我會分享一些我們的補給給你，但你得更小心些，以後最好別一個人出門旅行。」【失去10水果】
Well, the girl does look sad, and you’re a sucker for weeping damsels. ‘Well, ok then. I will share some of our supply, but you should be more careful and probably not travel on your own in the future.’ [Lose 10 fruit]

<STORY>>一瞬間你覺得女孩的臉上閃過一絲怒意，寒意爬上了你的脊髓。但一眨眼，她的舉止就恢復正常，甚至甜甜地向你微笑：
For a second you thought you saw a flash of anger on the girl’s face and chills run down your spine. But, in a blink of an eye, her demeanour goes back to normal and she even smiles at you sweetly:

「當然！我在想什麼呢！我真是個傻姑娘。讓我告訴你吧！我們別在意這些小分歧了，讓我們跳舞歡笑以忘卻憂愁吧！
‘Of course. What was I thinking! Silly lass. I tell you what though! Let’s not part on bad terms, let us dance and laugh and forget our worries for just a while!’
<ANS>不管你如何判斷，你敢發誓你聽到了附近有人在吹笛。年輕的女孩站了起來，她看上去真的很漂亮。管他呢，為什麼不跳一支舞呢，不會出什麼事的……
Despite your better judgement, you could swear you hear a flute playing somewhere near. The young lady stands up and she looks really nice. What the hell, why not have a dance, it can’t hurt…
<ANS>不管你如何判斷，你敢發誓你聽到了附近有人在吹笛。年輕的女孩站了起來，她看上去真的很漂亮。而這正是你不會和她跳舞的原因！「聽著，女孩，不管你是誰，我不想和你跳舞。去找你的姐姐們吧，以免受到傷害！」
Despite your better judgement, you could swear you hear a flute playing somewhere near. The young lady stands up and she looks really nice. And this is exactly why you’re not buying it! ‘Listen, girl, whoever you are, I want naught to do with you. Be off to your sisters, before some harm befalls you!’

You all dance together in a circle. The music gets louder, the world gets further away, and you dance and dance and dance…. You hear the girl’s soft voice, singing a beautiful and sad song and then you hear her laughter… 

當你從夢幻中甦醒的時候，你發現你的一位夥伴躺在地上，跳舞跳到神智不清……

<STORY>年輕的女孩突然笑了。她轉了一圈，就好像要開始一個人跳舞。脆弱的小女孩消失了，取而代之站在你面前的是一個高大威風的女人。她的雙眼覆蓋著一層白霧，她的皮膚上有淤青和浮腫。
The young girl suddenly laughs. She takes a swirl, as if she were about to start dancing on her own and instead of the frail youth, you are now faced with a tall, imposing woman, her eyes glazed with white fog, her skin bruised and bloated. 

隨著一聲狂野的尖叫，她衝向了你！

Upon reaching the lake you discover an older man slumped on the edge of the water, with a vase lying next to him. 

他的雙手被用紅緞帶綁在褲子兩邊。看上去他試圖把瓶子灌滿水，但由於雙手被綁住，他沒能成功。
The man has his hands tied to the sides of his trousers with bright red ribbons. It looks like he is trying to fill his vase with water, but with his hands tied as they are, he is not having much luck. 

他的皮膚乾燥而且脫皮嚴重。他的雙眼疲勞，空洞無神而且充血，很可能是哭泣導致。他的嘴也被看上去像海藻的東西縫了起來。
His skin looks very dry and kind of scaly, his eyes tired, empty and bloodshot, possibly from crying, and his mouth sewn up with what looks like seaweed.

As you approach the man and try to free him from his bindings, he shakes his head frantically at you, one moment to say no, another to encourage your actions. It seems his wits may be gone...

當你終於切斷繩子之後，男人掙脫了嘴上的海藻，開始邊拍手邊哭泣：
When you finally cut the ropes, the man breaks the seaweed gag and begins to clap his hands repeatedly while crying:

「哦不不不不不停，停下來！」
'Oh no, no, no, no stop, stop it!'

這男人發瘋般向你搖頭。你不太確定這是渴求你的幫助，或是希望你離開……

‘Yeah, well I did think of that, you know! But, first of all, I am not keen on dying, second, as soon as I am dead, a new Vodnik will take up residence, there must always be an Aquarius at the chosen waters. And the next one may not be as conscientious as I am!’

這就是為什麼我讓水澤女妖用紅絲帶綁住我的雙手。我無法掙脫紅絲帶，也就不能拍手了。」
This is why I had some water nymphs help me and tie my hands with the red ribbon. Its power made me unable to untie myself, and I could no longer clap!’

Driven by instinct alone, I will seek out life and haunt it, desperately trying to seek aid. Many would have slain my spirit by now, my thanks to your patience.’
<ANS>「是的，我們確實想過殺了你，但這對鬼來說有些多此一舉，還有你之前留下的詛咒。」<

‘If you find a way to release my spirit? Well, before the Darkness, my soul would have travelled through the roots of the Cosmic Tree into the Underworld, where it could rest in peace. Now… well, at least I won’t be an angry spirit, tormenting people, I think…’

The beast wakes and smells the meat. It flies down to grab his meal and devours it in seconds. 

一切看上去都很正常，但突然，龍的鼻孔和嘴開始冒煙。它伸出了舌頭，呼吸變得粗重，然後飛向了附近的一個湖。

<STORY>「我告訴過你，我知道他的弱點。這可憐的傢伙患有一種很危險的龍族消化功能紊亂。與此同時，它對有著羊的外表的東西有著偏好，這很奇怪。我想這是因為羊的外表會刺激到他。
‘I told ya, I knew his weakness. The poor fella suffered from a dangerous type of Draconic digestive disorder. At the same time, he was partial to lambs, visually, strangely enough, I think the sight of them irritated him. 

無論如何，我用了一些材料——也包括你們帶來的那些——來製作能使他病情劇烈惡化的假羊。
In any case, I used certain materials, including the ones ya brought, to make fake sheep that would cause a flare up of his condition. 

唯一的緩解方法是大量喝水，但我讓這羊十分堅挺。他不得不持續喝水，我都快為他感到抱歉。
The only remedy then is to drink a lot of water, but I made the sheep so strong, he just had to keep on drinkin’, almost feel sorry for the fella.

One of the figures at the table turns to you, and for a second you see only a skull, but then you blink and an old man's face stares at you:

「孩子，你是來這裡尋求知識，還是渴求鮮血？前者，大廳裡數之不盡；後者，你來錯地方了。」

<PHASE>ID: 22
<STORY>「這並不簡單，沒有強大的邪惡魔法的幫助幾乎無法達成。但我們做到了。你看，眾神有自己的職責，這既是他們的優勢，也是劣勢。
'It was not easy, nor done without the aid of powerful and evil magic. But it was done. Each God, you see, had their own duty, their domain and it was both their strength and their weakness. 

我們同時襲擊了他們，沒有給他們像往常一樣互伸援手的機會。」

<STORY>「然而那完全就是個笑話，我們都被人類進化部門給耍了。
'Well, that's a funny story in itself I suppose. We were tricked by the Human Advancement department. 

我們被錯誤的數據誤導，認為眾神變得傲慢，想要摧毀所有生命並將人類從西婭抹去，然後重新創造更加順從的新物種。不管怎樣，那全都是謊言，而那些知道真相的人已不再與我們為伍。」
We were presented with false data to suggest that the Gods were about to destroy all life, that they'd grown arrogant and wanted to wipe Thea of humans to create new, more obedient kind. Anyway, it was all a lie, and those who knew the real reason are no longer with us.’
<ANS>「所以你們差點毀掉了西婭，只因為那個被證明是胡說八道的理論？」
'So you have pretty much destroyed Thea, for a theory that turned out to be bollocks?'
<ANS>「你是認真的？！你們褻瀆眾神，還燒掉了神聖的樹，就因為一紙理論？」
'Are you serious!? You defied the Gods and burned the sacred Tree, for a theory?'

<PHASE>ID: 24
<STORY>「沒錯，雖然是事後諸葛，但我們的所作所為實在是愚蠢可笑。但你也只是旁觀者清！那個理論實在是完美，我的意思是，沒有確切的證據證明眾神不會這麼干……」
'Yeah, in hindsight, it all seems rather ridiculous. But you don't know how it is when you're in the zone! And it was a good theory, in principle. I mean there is no definite proof that the Gods didn't plan our demise...'

<ANS>「好吧，我們信你了，說說你們具體是怎麼幹的？」
'Ok, let's say we believe you. How exactly did you do it?'

<PHASE>ID: 27
<STORY>「大體上，我們只需要把眾神互相之間引開足夠遠，給人類進化部門爭取足夠的時間去摧毀秩序之樹。
'In principle, all we had to do, is distract each deity long enough, so that the other department, the Human Advancement, had time to destroy the Cosmic Tree. 

但是，我們意識到如果不用最強的魔法，那我們必定失敗。長者不可能幫助我們，他們都向世界支柱宣誓永遠盡忠，許多國王和女王同樣為眾神而戰，守護聖地。因此，想要找到符合我們要求的大魔法師是不可能的。」
But, we realised that without magic of the strongest kind, we would fail. The Elder peoples would not help of course, they were sworn to uphold the Pillars of the World, many human kings and queens were also charged with championing the Gods or protecting these sacred places, thus finding grand Mages willing to the job was impossible.'
<ANS>「所以你們開始使用黑魔法？」
'So you turned to the Dark Magics?'

<PHASE>ID: 28
<STORY>「是的，或者說是他們來拜訪我們。我猜他們對這方面情報很敏感。一位魔法師登門拜訪，給了我們所有的答案。
'Yes, or rather they turned to us. I guess they have a nose for such thing. A Mage arrived at our doorstep, offering all the right answers. 

即使後來我們發現他就是臭名昭著的黑暗之主，在很久以前西境的神目之戰中被放逐，我們依然接受了他。我們別無選擇。」
Even after we figured he was the famed Dark Lord, banished ages ago in the Great War of the Eye in the Westerlands, we still couldn't say no. It was him or nothing.'
<ANS>「所以，投身於徹底的邪惡，它曾經不止一次毀滅不止多個大陸，你覺得會沒有問題？嗯，你說你曾是教授？」
'So, faced with working with an entity so evil, that it almost devoured our world, more than once, on more than one continent, you thought it will all be fine? Mhm, you said you were a professor?'
<ANS>「你媽沒教過你物極必反嗎？我是說，黑暗之主——這可不是會無償助人的名字……」

<PHASE>ID: 29
<STORY>「哦，別誤會，我們很清楚自己正與邪惡為伍。但是，追求知識、追求萬物解析……我們甚至能與神對抗！何等光榮！黑暗之主不費吹灰之力就說服了我們。」
'Oh, don't get me wrong. We knew we were working with evil. But, the pursuit of knowledge, of understanding…  The very notion we could defy the Gods! It was glorious! I think the Dark Lord didn't even break a sweat convincing us.'
<ANS>「無恥！而且竟然無人意識到這麼做的後果？」
'Disgusting! And you're telling us no one realised what you were up to? '
<ANS>「聽上去挺偉大。不過，就沒人發現計劃有多蠢嗎？」
‘I guess it does sound rather grand. But, did no one see the foolishness of your plans?’

<PHASE>ID: 30
<STORY>「確實受到懷疑，甚至某些神都有所察覺，不過黑暗之主每次都機智地轉移了他們的注意力。在他古老的要塞裡組建了虛假的軍隊，散佈他即將捲土重來的消息。這就是我們計劃的第一步，也是我們騙過至高神的方法！」
'There were suspicions. Some Gods even took notice, but the Dark One was clever and diverted their gaze every time, building a fake army in his old stronghold, and sending out omens of his return worldwide. This was step one of our plan. This was how we would trap the Supreme Gods!'
<ANS>「至高神？」
'The supreme Gods?'

<PHASE>ID: 31
<STORY>「是的，就像東境是佩龍和莫科史的領域，每塊大陸都有自己的神。首先他們需要被分割，否則他們的力量將會彼此保護。莫科史，她很聰明心細，我們無法吸引她。而佩龍，一言以蔽之，他會不顧一切向戰場飛奔！」
Yes, like Perun and Mokosh in the Easterlands, every land in Thea had their own. They needed to be broken first, else their power would protect the others. Mokosh, we could not lure away, she is wise and careful. But, Perun, well, let's just say he was keen to go into battle, very keen!'
<ANS>「所以，你們故作喧囂讓佩龍急忙趕來？然後呢？」
'So what, you just made some racket and Perun came running? And then what?'
<ANS>「你說莫科史沒有上鉤，那你們是怎麼引開她的？」
'So you said Mokosh didn't bite your bait, so how did you make her distracted?'
<ANS>「韋萊斯，冥界之主，你們怎麼騙到這個老狐狸的？」
'And Veles, the Lord of the Underworld? How did you trick the trickster?'
<ANS>「莫樂娜是聰明的女神，她沒被你們騙到吧？」
'Morena is a wise Goddess, surely she did not fall to your deception?'
<ANS>「所以佐婭擅離職守，加入了即將到來的戰爭？」
'So did Zorya drop her duty of guardianship to join the upcoming war?'
<ANS>「赫爾斯，暗夜之主，肯定看穿了黑暗之主的陰謀。」
'Horos, the Lord of the Night, surely saw through your Dark Lord's scheme.'
<ANS>「光明之神，斯瓦洛格，他一定察覺到了黑暗吧？」
'The God of Light, Svarog, must have sensed the looming Darkness, surely?'
<ANS>「拉達女神完全與此無關，為什麼她也力量受制？」

'Well it was more than a racket, it was the rise of the Dark Lord... anyway, in short, yes, but not only Perun, all three of the Thunder Gods came, The northern God, Thor, and the southern, Zeus, the three brothers united and fell straight into our lightning rod! Ha!'
<ANS>「避雷針？你用一根雄偉的避雷針去挑逗雷電之神，嗯？」
'A lightning rod? You lured the Thunder Gods with a rod bigger than theirs eh?'

<PHASE>ID: 33
<STORY>「嗯，老實說她很容易搞定，只因為她和西婭聯繫得如此緊密。這是最羞恥的行動之一，在我們毀滅世界之前。
'Well, in truth, she was the easy one, but only because she is so intimately connected to Thea. It was actually one of most shameful acts, well, before we realised we destroyed the world that is. 

有一座神聖的花園，生命的搖籃，位於海洋深處。精靈們常去那裡，讓靈魂從勞累的軀體中釋放出來，轉化為純淨的能量。
There was a sacred garden, a cradle of life, deep within the oceans. The Elven people often went there to release their souls from the burden of their bodies and thus become pure energy. 

那是莫科史最愛的地方，而我們摧毀了那裡。如此沉重的打擊，讓她很長時間都沒有恢復，足以讓我們實行下一步。」
It was the favoured seat of Mokosh, and we destroyed it. The blow was so severe, she was in shock for long enough for phase two.'

'Dare we even ask what phase two was...?

'Ah yes, Veles, who sat in the roots of the tree, guarding the gates to the afterlife. He would lose power from the Cosmic Tree's demise, but we needed him distracted more than most. 

但韋萊斯不只是冥界主人，他也是魔法之主，還有人說他是精靈王，然後才成為神。
But Veles is not only the Master of the Underworld, he is also the Lord of Magic, and some say, he was of the Elven kin First, before he became God. 

精靈們準備離開人類領土的時候，我們襲擊了他們的居住區西部群島。於是，和許多的精靈衛兵一樣，韋萊斯趕回去鎮守家園。」
We attacked the Western Islands where the Elves dwelt when they wished to leave the human realms. Veles ran to their aid, and so did many Elven guardians.'
<ANS>「所以這足以把他從秩序之樹引開？」
'So it was enough just to lure him away from the Tree?'

<STORY>「莫樂娜女神……幾個世紀以來都是我們的守護神和導師。背叛她我們心裡也不好受，但我們用她會理解我們來強行安慰自己。
‘The Lady Morena... our patron and guide for centuries. Our betrayal of the Goddess stung us deeper than any other, but we argued to ourselves that she would approve of such prudent and pragmatic approach. 

當莫樂娜降臨，意識到我們的計劃，並詢問我們的理由。隨即我們展開了激烈辯論，並向她展示了我們的理論。
When our Patron appeared to us, realising what we were doing, and as ever, asking us for the reasoning for our deeds, we entered into the debate and presented her with our theoretical considerations.

不管怎樣，我們背叛了她，用骯髒邪惡的魔法暫時困住了她，爭取到足夠時間讓我們摧毀至高學府，對莫樂娜掌管的知識揮出致命一擊。」
However, the betrayal came from using filthy magic to temporarily trap our guest, just long enough for us to destroy all the Grand Universities, including ours, at once, striking a great blow to Morena's domain of knowledge.'
<ANS>「所以，一些建築被摧毀，女神就失去了力量？怎麼可能？」
'So what, destroying some buildings made our Goddess lose her power? Surely not?'

'Zorya is nothing if she is not honourable and valiant! The world devouring beast Simargl, could not be held at bay by any other in the Pantheon. When Perun was called away to fight the Dark Lord, he commanded his son Svarog to bring his hammer down on the looming Darkness. 

佐婭身為盡職盡責的女兒留了下來，負責在戰鬥打響時守衛神座。
Zorya, as the dutiful daughter that she remains, was charged with holding the divine throne while the battle took place. 

我們趁機破壞了束縛斯瑪格爾的鎖鏈以引開佐婭——說實話，我們那時根本沒意識到我們釋放的東西有多可怕！」
We used that distraction to break the beast Simargl’s chain - and in truth, even we did not fully comprehend what we unleashed!'
<ANS>「對呀，不就是一隻吞噬世界的野獸嘛……現在那野獸可以為所欲為了！那佐婭的力量還在嗎？」

'With the aid of the Dark Lord, we managed to worm our way into Horos' flock and slowly shake his dominion over Easterland's night creatures. You see, centuries, or perhaps millennia ago, Horos freed many such creatures from the corruption of the Dark Lords and showed them instead his own path. 

可惜，我們運用腐敗的力量製造混亂和猜疑。赫爾斯的統治開始舉步維艱，而且在他發現真相之前，整個計劃早已啟動。最終，一位偉大的古老吸血之王吸取了赫爾斯的力量！」
Alas, we used the power of corruption to create confusion and doubt. Horos came down hard on his straying flock, but before he could discover the true nature of their descent, our plans were in motion, and a great, ancient Leech Lord siphoned Horos’ might from him!'

但很快，他發現他的兄弟姐妹以及孩子們都處在生死邊緣。幾近崩潰的他只能選擇救其中一方。我們持續這麼折磨他，直到他選擇了他的兄弟韋萊斯。那時我們已經創造了一個黑洞，吸收了斯瓦洛格的光芒，削弱他的力量，讓他再無神力。」
But then, he felt his siblings and children are all in peril. He was torn trying to choose whom to aid, and alas, we preyed on his loyalty, for by the time he chose his brother Veles, we managed to create a black hole that caught Svarog's light and weakened him enough to be rendered useless.'

Lada was born on the day the Cosmic Tree burned and all seemed lost and doomed. A single seed survived the burning, holding within it the power of rebirth, but also giving life to the new Goddess, one that would help restore mankind!

唉，身為最年輕的神，她卻獻出了自己的力量，保全家人的生命。她也因此失去大部分的力量。」

Strangely, you start to feel like schoolchildren, about to get a detention... 

你的神對你的失敗感到非常不快，你的內心充滿了愧疚和罪惡感。
Your Gods are clearly displeased with your failure and so your hearts are filled with shame and guilt. 

不過學者們沒有再做什麼，你們順利帶著下次探索地點的信息離開了。

You take your time to meditate and find your inner peace. In this place of sorrow and darkness, you seek a link to your Gods by opening up your hearts and souls. In time, the connection works and you are able to use it to cleanse the bonds of the forsaken scholars!

但是，當他們的靈魂消散，在地板上留下毫無生氣的屍體時，你感到了神的巨大憤怒和失望！你終結了眾神降下的懲罰，現在你開始為你的行為感到羞愧……
But, as their souls disperse and leave this place and their bodies fall lifeless on the ground, you feel the anger and disappointment of your deity upon you! You have broken the punishment set out by the Gods, and you now feel the shame of your deeds...

你知道接下來該去哪兒了，不過你沒有得到任何祝福！
You know where to go next to seek answers, but you go without the blessing of your deity!

可是此地被太多的黑暗與邪惡所污染，你和神的連接不足以幫助這些學者。
But this place has been stained with too much darkness and evil and your connection to the Gods is too weak to aid the scholars. 

教授們只是點頭致謝，便回到桌子旁討論你的失敗。
The professors only nod in thanks and return to their table, debating a theory of why you failed. 

之後他們不再回應，你只好離開這裡。你感受到神極其失望，壓得你透不過氣……
They do not respond to any hails and so you are left with no recourse but to leave the place. As you do, you feel the great disappointment of your Gods weighing down upon your shoulders...

學者們只是點了點頭便回到了圓桌旁。你聽到他們正在討論你的決定。
The academics simply nod and return to their table, you hear them debating the merits of your decision.

當你走下樓梯離開這個詛咒之地時，突然感到一陣寒意在心臟蔓延，一股強烈的不滿充斥著你的腦海，神明顯對你的作為感到十分不快！
As you climb down the stairs and leave the cursed town behind you, you feel a chill grab hold of your hearts, a strong displeasure fills your minds and you know your Gods are not pleased with your inaction!

Once we had all the greatest heroes in one place, we detonated the hellish thing and it spread like wildfire. It would not kill any of them you know! 

它能使他們體內的魔法超載，使他們暫時性昏厥。但你看，這個裝置有個強力的副作用……」

一位學者說道：
You explore the University and find your way into an old lecture room where cursed academics approach you. They are the ones that caused the downfall of the Gods and thus allowed for the burning of the Cosmic Tree.
One speaks:

「似乎你們的神指引你來到這裡幫助他恢復力量。」

'Who am I you ask? Hmm. Me and my kind go by many names. Wizards, some called us in days past, The Council of Six, we were too, Emissaries, or prophets even by some, or rascals, necromancers and meddlers by others.

在東境，我被稱為科斯提——或是骨人，如果你更喜歡直白的稱呼的話……
Here in the Easterlands, Kostey is the name given to me now - or The Boneman if you prefer a more literal nickname...

But this answers your question not.

我只能說這麼多。我與其他科斯提，我們長期作為凡人魔法的監視者，或者說導師——如果你喜歡這麼叫的話。因此，我們最常用的稱號是巫師。
I will tell you this much. I and my fellow Kostey, we have long been appointed custodians, or mentors if you like, to all mortal magic users. Hence our most common name, Wizards. 

但是自從秩序之樹被燒燬之後，我們與魔法和造物主的紐帶被削弱了，使我們的身體枯萎，衰弱，最後骨瘦如柴——因此被稱為骨人，被當作死亡的預兆而被恐懼著。
But when the Cosmic Tree burned, our connection to both Magic and the Creator weakened, leaving our bodies withered and frail, bony you may say - the Bonemen were thus born, feared as heralds of death. 

我不介意這個稱號，也不在乎我的社會形象。
I do not mind this name, nor its weight on my social standing.

And with every drowning, Morena will die and be reborn with more power!’

死之化身揮舞著她的鐮刀做好了莫樂娜的雕像。化身將一片她自己的衣服放在雕像上，點頭向你致意她已準備好了。
Death waves her scythe and an effigy of Morena is made. The avatar then places a piece of her own clothes onto the effigy and nods to you to signal its readiness.

It will intensify every death Morena feels, it will also make the winters harsher and more deadly, but in turn, the rebirth will be stronger.

‘A ssimple talk iss inssufficient here. Thiss poor ssoul was driven mad when all but a few of his kindred perished and then the sacred tree burned. He carries a burden beyond even his immortal sstrength.

You say you were sent by the Elven brother, Veles Allasandir the Wise, and that he has asked you to release my burden – this I will now do, and may you restore what was lost to us!’

精靈張開他的雙臂，你第一次看清楚他的眼睛。就在這時，源源不斷的魔力從他身體裡湧出，匯聚成一塊石頭。

<STORY>蛇開始向你說話，而你知道它沒說謊：
The snake speaks and you know in heart that he speaks true:

「這精靈已經命懸一線了。但如果你加速精靈流浪者的死亡作為獻祭，韋萊斯將會得到更多力量。通過這一殘酷的行動，你可以擁抱韋萊斯的陰暗面，使他成為冥界的真正主宰。作為至高統治者，韋萊斯絕不會容許這種局面再次出現！
‘The Elf is dying anyway. But, if you sacrifice the life of this Elven Wanderer by quickening his demise, Veles will gain more power. By doing this one brutal deed, you can embrace Veles’ darker side and he will become a true master of the Underworlds, one that rules supreme and will never again allow for such a travesty to occur. 

靈魂的管理者應當是最上位者，而握有來世之鑰的神，應當帶領我們走向新的時代！」
The safekeeping of our souls should be paramount, and the one who holds the key to the afterlife, should be the one to guide us into the next era!’
<ANS>是的，是時候讓韋萊斯踏出陰影並釋放真正力量了！殺死精靈，向韋萊斯獻上真正的力量！
Yes, it is time for Veles to step out of the shadows and show his true power! Take the Elf’s life and give true might to your God!

Once all the magic leaves his body, you see the Elf weakening and perishing before your eyes. 

當你觸摸留下的石頭時，你能感到韋萊斯正通過你取回力量！
When you touch the magic stone that remains, you feel Veles draining its power through you!

韋萊斯將需要很長時間甚至數十年來恢復力量。但當他完全恢復後，他將重建萬神殿，恢復萬物平衡！
It will take long years, decades, for your God to fully restore his power, but once he does, he can help rebuild the Pantheon and restore balance!

當生命的痕跡從他的軀體上完全消失時，他永生的靈魂與這塊石頭融合在了一起，讓石頭的力量變得無比強大！
When life leaves his body completely, his immortal soul merges with the magical stone and amplifies it beyond measure!

你突然意識到他根本不是什麼普通的精靈，而是古老的精靈王，第一批踏上西婭的精靈之一！
You now realise this was not just any Elf, he was the ancient Elven King, one of the first to ever walk Thea!

你已經感受到韋萊斯的力量在增長，雖然其中參雜著一些黑暗，但並不邪惡。畢竟，死亡並無善惡之分，你的神現在將成為死亡之主！
You already feel Veles’ power growing and although there is a drop of darkness to this new rise, it is not evil at all. Death after all, is neither good nor bad and your master will now become a Death Lord!

韋萊斯將花費數十年才能完全顯現力量，但你已經改變了萬神殿！

<STORY>拉達女神所說的村莊，原來是湖邊的哥布林村落。
The village your Lady Lada spoke of, turns out to be a small, Goblin settlement by a lake. 

但這些哥布林有的被關在籠子裡，一些被拴在樹上。他們被水澤女妖奴役著，很可能是人魚。
But the Goblins are kept in cages or on leashes and ruled by a group of water nymphs, most likely Rusalkas.

<STORY>你靠近村莊並暗中觀察。
You get in closer and inspect the village.

幾個水澤女妖分散站在村莊裡。其中一個站在村莊中央的大石頭上，唱著令人沉迷的歌。村落裡工作著的哥布林似乎已經被催眠了，而籠子裡的哥布林尚存清醒的意志。
There are several of the Water Nymphs scattered around the place, with one sitting on a large stone in the middle, singing an entrancing song. You see the Goblins that work in the settlement seem hypnotised by the melody, while those in cages are somehow resistant to it.

你懷疑拉達根本不希望武力解決，所以外交似乎是唯一手段。雖然你依然不明白這能對女神有什麼幫助……
You suspect an outright assault is not what Lada had in mind, so diplomacy may be the only way. Although you're still unsure of how this will help your Goddess...
<ANS>再觀察一下情況，找到弱點或是別的什麼辦法進去。聽從你的直覺和拉達的指示。

The water nymphs seem bored with their little kingdom. You see that some of them argue among each other and some simply leave into the lake, abandoning their duties. 

甚至她們的領袖，唱著河流之歌的水澤女神，也似乎灰心喪氣。
Even their leader, singing the song of the river, seems disheartened and sad. 

你感到了拉達的存在，似乎可以哄騙她們離開這裡。
You feel the presence of Lada upon you and you know you can try to trick these nymphs into leaving this place.
<ANS>「你們好，女士們。我們應拉達女神之邀前來，有些消息要告訴你們！有個地方能讓你們找到比哥布林更好的追隨者！」【智力】

The villagers are scared and shell shocked, but one comes up to you. He is very, very old, barely taller than a toddler, has a long silver beard and no eyes:

「我知道是你救了我們。我知道你在尋找什麼——村莊裡有一棵與眾不同的樹苗，它與拉達在同一天誕生。把這棵樹移植到你的村莊裡，女神拉達將會隨著時間增長力量！」
'You have saved us, just as I have seen. Now, I will tell you what you seek. Our village has a special tree sapling, one that was born on the same day as Lada. Plant this in your village, and in time, your Goddess will grow in strength!'

「你似乎擁有神聖的力量，但這力量很新，我們不知道是哪位神。你是誰，來這裡有什麼事？」
'You smell of divine power, but it is strange, new, nothing we know. Who are you and what do you want here?'
<ANS>「我們是來幫助這個村莊的。我們的女神拉達——愛與美之神——希望你們能與哥布林和諧相處，而不是奴役他們！當然你們這樣美麗的女性一定會聽從女神的指令，不是嗎？」【交涉】
'We are here to help this village. Our Goddess Lada - Lady of beauty and love -wishes you to live in peace with these goblins, not to enslave and hurt them! Surely such beautiful creatures as you should follow our Lady’s voice?'   [Social]

<PHASE>ID: 10
<STORY>「是的，你是對的，朋友。你的女神拉達用她生命的力量來維持萬神殿，維持神的生命，直到太陽再次升起。
'Yes, you are right my friend. Your Lady Lada gave her own life force to sustain the Pantheon, to keep the Gods alive until the sun returned.

我們的樹苗與拉達息息相關，泥土下的樹根代表著她與眾神的連接。如果你砍掉樹根，拉達將不再為眾神提供力量，她的力量將會加速增長。
Our tree sapling is connected to your Lady in many ways, it has roots that represent her bond to the other Gods. If you choose to cut away all those roots, Lada will no longer give her own power to her kin and its might will grow much faster.

這也會改變她，讓她純潔的心靈中萌生野心與陰暗——我並不是說她會變得邪惡，只是會有所改變，更像其他眾神。但是，從此之後她會變成至高女神，如果真像這樣，難道拉達不會為我們帶來愛與和平的時代嗎？
This will also change her, it will allow a seed of ambition and darkness to a heart that is pure - I do not mean she will become evil, just changed, more like the others. But, she will then be the Supreme Goddess, and as such, will she not bring us an era of peace and love? 

這是你需要決定的。」
That is what you must decide.'
<ANS>「是的，我們會斬斷樹根！是時候讓拉達女神昇華並獲得真正的力量了！她將引領眾神走上愛與美之路！」
‘Yes, we will cut the roots! It is time Lada became more, gained true power and guided the other Gods on a path of love and beauty supreme!’
<ANS>「不！拉達最好維持原狀，握有一塵不染的力量。她將為萬神殿帶來平衡與穩定。」
‘No! Lada is better off as she is, without the taint of power. She will bring balance and stability to the Pantheon.’

It will take years if not decades for any true effect to take form, but in time, Lada will regain her power and thus will be able to revitalise the whole Pantheon!

這一大膽的舉動在拉達心中掀起漣漪，喚醒了更加雄心勃勃而且充滿決意的女神。她將興起，並掌控她古老的親族，並親手帶領西婭進入力量與激情的新時代！的確，這其中也有風險，些許的美麗將轉變為嫉妒，但這畢竟不會一成不變！
This bold move creates a ripple in her heart and wakes a more ambitious and determined Goddess, one that will rise up and take charge of her older kin, and guide Thea into a new era with strength and compassion hand in hand! True, there is an air of danger now, a glimmer of terrible beauty turning to malice, but it is not set in stone!

拉達將花費數十年的時間成長並興起，但你已經永久改變了萬神殿，使它更具吸引力了！

The dark obsidian stone that lies before you is the heart of Zmey and if powered with Svarog’s light, it will amplify the power of the shrine, giving Svarog the edge to finally become a Supreme God.

這意味著佩龍與莫科史將被廢黜，萬神殿的力量將被改變。但最後，太陽之主的時代將會降臨西婭！

這是一隻科莫魑。人們通常認為它會攻擊懶人，賜予他們疾病，或讓他們淹死在水中。故事源於他們天性害羞且隱秘。這可能是史上第一次有人能夠盯著它那麼久。
This is a Cmuch. People often think it attacks lazy people, giving them disease or making them drown in the waters. These stories stem from the creatures being extremely shy and secretive. This is likely the first time anyone could gaze upon a Cmuch this long.

事實上，這些生物能夠探測到疾病和虛弱。如果患者努力自力更生，科莫魑就會吞噬疾病並治癒患者。
The truth is, these creatures smell disease and weakness and if the sickened person is on its own, the Cmuch eats their disease, helping them to heal!

但這也說明它們有極強的傳染性。如果離他們太近，你有很大概率被疾病感染。
It does however mean that they are usually highly contagious and likely to give you some sickness if you come closer!

On the other hand, you have heard stories of it preying on what it deems as ‘lazy people’ and the stories say that if the Cmuch decides you are useless, it will appear to you and smack you with its toad tongue and after that you die within hours!

You’re not sure which story is true, but the creature looks unhealthy and it will likely die soon.

<STORY>剃禮，這是東境的一種簡單的資格儀式。
The time of The Cropping, used to be a simple rite of passage in the Easterlands. 

根據孩子們的天賦，他們將有不同的髮型。戰士會剃成平頭，工匠們會把頭髮編成辮子，還有極少數有志於巫師或智者的人，他們會剃光。
Depending on the child's talents, it would either have its hair cropped, to join the ranks of the warriors, or it would have its hair plaited, to symbolise their aptitude for knowledge and the crafts; on rare occasions, the head would be shaved, to signal the makings of a witch or a wise one.

現在，在黑暗時代，這一儀式變得更加苛刻致命！但這仍是一種讓你的人民更加強大的方式，讓你們更有機會對抗黑暗。

The arena is a test for those who are to become Warriors or Hunters. Six children enter the fighting pits and only one emerges! The victor is blessed by the Gods with strength to keep you safe!

精神之旅是一個古老的儀式，六個孩子將一起神遊進入精神世界。有些人永遠無法歸來，但那些被證明有價值的人將變得更強大，他們會成為魔法師或智者，用智慧引導你！
The spirit walk is an ancient ritual, where six children enter a trance together and travel the spirit world. Some will never return, but those who prove worthy may become many things, including Magic users or Wise Men and Women who lead you with their knowledge!

也許寧靜之屋是最安全的考驗，但有的人仍然太弱小了不能通過考驗。六個孩子進入密封的房間，沒有食物或水，只有工具。如果他們擁有足夠智慧，不止一個人會活下來，他們將成為工匠！
The quiet room is perhaps the safest trial, and yet some may still prove too weak to endure it. Six children enter, the room is sealed with no food and water, but only tools. More than one may emerge if they prove their wits and they will join the ranks of the Workers!

「這些賤民是誰？！他們為什麼擋我的路？讓他們消失，現在馬上！」
‘Who are these peasants?! Why do they stand in My way? Make them disappear, now!’

那女孩轉過身走開了一段距離，像是在等著自己的命令被執行。那蒙面人長歎一聲對你說：
The girl turns and walks off a few meters as if awaiting her command to be carried out. The hooded man lets out a long sigh and speaks to you:

「蘇珊娜公主殿下希望你們讓開道路！」
‘Her majesty, Princes Zuzanna wishes you to clear the way!’

「聽著，你們似乎是好人，讓我想起了黑暗之前，我們淪落至此之前的時光……但你必須理解，她瘋了，一直如此，她是地獄之子，命中注定擁有永久的驕傲與殘酷！」
‘Listen, you seem like good folks, you remind me of times before the Darkness and before our...fate… but you must understand, she is mad, always has been, infernal child, doomed for eternity for her pride and cruelty!’

‘HRH Zuzanna really was a princess and an only, precious child to our royals. As such, she was spoilt rotten, but worse yet, people say she’s been a changeling from the start. Learned men and wizards from all over came to test the child, and they all felt that her little heart was nought but an icy hole. 

但國王夫婦拒絕聽從他們，而是相信真愛會治癒她，最終使她變成人。
But our royal couple refused to listen, believed that true love will cure her and make her human in the end.

這一度接近成功，但隨著蘇珊娜長大，她的小脾氣變成了蓄意施暴。
For a time it seemed like it was true, but then, Zuzanna grew older and with every passing year, her cute tantrums, became more cruel and intentional.

她鞭撻僕人，只因為他們沒有正確目視自己；她將男侍者鎖在鳥屋裡，認為他們會長出翅膀娛樂她，你能想像到嗎？」

The dark magic that sat inside the princess’ heart forms into its true visage, a malevolent soul, vicious, evil, but without a conscious mind, a spirit that must have been sewn into the girl’s soul when she was but a babe!
The spirit is taken by your flames and disappears with a silent scream on its twisted face!

公主喘息著說：
The princess gasps:

「怎麼……那是什麼？」
‘How…What was that?’

她看起來由衷的恐懼和釋然。
She looks genuinely scared and relieved.

她的侍衛們看起來很迷惑。
Her soldiers look very confused.
<ANS>「這許多年以來，是邪惡的靈魂佔據了你的心，公主。某些人在你還是個孩子的時候就詛咒了你，並在你的心臟中埋入了死靈。那靈魂在憤怒和絕望中成長——也讓你的靈魂變得黑暗了。不能把你的所有罪行都歸罪於它，但有它在你心裡，真的很難保持正義之路！」
‘It was the evil spirit that possessed your heart all those years ago, princess. Someone has cursed you as a child and sewn a dead soul into your heart. This soul grew in anger and desperation – likely making your own soul darken as well. That is not to say all your actions can be blamed on this, but it would not have been easy to stay on a righteous path with that inside of you!’

<STORY>謝謝你……我感到，不同了。心中不那麼，憤怒和沉重。我一直知道我的體內有著什麼，我只是覺得它就是我，我很早以前就接受了。我，我停止了去抗爭它……真希望我沒有停止。也許一切都會……但沒關係了。
'Thank you... I feel, different. Less, angry and heavy inside. I always knew there was something within me, I just assumed it was who I was and I had accepted it long ago. I, I stopped fighting it... If I hadn’t. Perhaps things would have been... But never mind. 

我仍必須去那座冰塔，我必須試著打破剩下的詛咒，為了我自己，也為了容忍了我這麼久的侍衛們。
I must still go to the icy tower, I must try to break this curse that remains, for my sake, and for my soldiers, who have endured my presence for long enough.

'Ha you fools! You have finally given me full control! I have waited so long, fought with this foolish girl's pure heart! And now I am free!

謝謝你們，賤民！現在滾吧！」
Thank you, peasants! Now leave my sight!'

公主在一陣黑煙中消失了，傷了一些你的人！
The princess disappears in puff of black smoke that hurts some of your people! 

在她消失前你看到她眼中人性的微光一閃而過，一張地圖出現在地上，上面標注了冰塔的所在。

‘For all the good you did, I still fell prey to this trap. I could not resist sitting on this throne, even after my heart had been freed. It seems pride lives in me, regardless. I must now pay for my crimes and stay here forever, with my judge staring at me for eternity!’

’Presumptuous mortalssss, I should ssstrike you down for your tone! But I feelsss that you may have been ledsss astray. The girl you speak of ssso bravely, is my Egle, my wife!

蛇王用尾巴把她的妻子裹了起來：
The snake king wraps his tail around his wife:

「你的兄弟，一群懦夫，又想讓我死。這次，他們還誘騙這些人替他們動手。幸運的是，這些勇士識破了詭計，殺了你那沒骨氣的親屬！」
‘Your brothersss, the cowards that they were, wantedsss me dead, again. Thisss time, they foundsss and tricked these here peoplesss to do their dirty worksss. Luckily, these brave warriorssss saw through the deceit, and killed your spinelesss kin!’ 

埃格勒邊哭邊說：「我知道他們另有所謀。他們把我鎖在小屋裡，還說我無法再令他們蒙羞！老公我們回家吧，讓我們忘掉過去，追尋未來！」
Egle speaks up, while sobbing: ‘I knew they were up to something evil. They locked me up in the house and said I will not shame them anymore! Let us go home husband, let us forget my past life and look to the future!’

蛇王點了點頭，然後轉向你：
The snake king nods, then turns to you:

「哦 不！這兒發生了什麼？他們是我的兄弟！」
‘Oh no! What happened here? They are my brothers!’
<ANS>「他們中一人試著誘使我們去殺蛇王，說蛇王綁架了一個女孩，但事還沒完。當我們說不願幫忙時，他們就開始攻擊我們。」

<STORY>女孩鎮靜地點了點頭，話語悲傷而顫抖：
The girl nods calmly, and speaks in a sad, quaking voice: 

「我知道這終會像這樣結束的。我就是埃格勒，蛇王撒爾提的妻子。我並非囚徒。我的兄弟一直對我的選擇感到羞恥和憤怒，他們一直想殺了我的丈夫。我知道他們咎由自取，但畢竟是我的兄弟……請，讓我一個人靜靜。」
‘I knew it all had to end this way eventually. I am Egle, I am the wife of Zoltis, the snake king. I am no prisoner. My brothers were angry and ashamed of my choice and so they kept trying to kill my husband. I know they brought this on their own heads, but they were my brothers… Please, leave me be now.’ 

埃格勒站在岸邊叫了三次那個名字：「撒爾提，撒爾提，撒爾提。」一個巨大的半人半蛇的生物從水裡浮現並擁抱了她。他們一起消失在湖中，但蛇王還給你留下了一個箱子！
Egle stands on the shore and speaks a name three times: ‘Zoltis, Zoltis, Zoltis.’ A great snake-like creature with a part human body, appears from the waters and embraces her. They disappear into the lake together, but the snake leaves behind a chest for you!

As you travel, you meet a scruffy, young man sitting atop a rock, feverishly cleaning his sword. When he finally spots you, he jumps to his feet and calls out:

「你好，旅行者們！願你們一路順風。我是屠龍者，我正要開始我的偉大冒險！」
‘Hey there fellow travellers! May the Road bless you. I am a Dragon slayer and I am about to commence on a great adventure!’

一時間男孩看上去有些動搖，但很快鎮靜下來，拍了拍手再次說道：
The boy looks unsure for a second, but quickly regains composure, he claps his hands and speaks again:

「我的心上人告訴我只要能獻上龍的頭顱，她就會點頭下嫁！你看，我已經找到了龍的蹤跡！它是只翼蜥，雖然不是巨龍，但還是可憎的野獸。它能把你變成石頭，懂嗎？
‘The mistress of my heart told me she can only be mine once I bring her the head of a Dragon! And I have tracked one down, you know! It is a Basilisk, not a full Dragon, but still, a nasty beast. It can turn you into stone, you know? 

但我知道如何擊敗它！我只需要一些銀來製造一面銀鏡。龍不喜歡銀，而且翼蜥的目光可以石化人們。所以，如果它看向銀鏡，它自己就會變成石頭！就是這樣，你們有銀嗎？」
But, I know how to beat it! I just need some silver and then I can turn it into a kind of mirror. Beasts dislike silver, you see, and the Basilisk turns people to stone by looking at them. So, if it looks into the silver plate, it’ll be turned into stone! So, do you have some silver?’
<ANS>「噢，當然，我們有。給。」【失去2銀】
’Yeah, sure, why not. Have some’. [Lose 2 silver]
<ANS>「這是我這麼久以來聽過最愚蠢的事了，小男孩。首先，那個女孩明顯是在暗示你放棄，我是說，為她殺一條龍，得了吧。很明顯你應該……別再煩她了。第二，你的計劃只是一紙空談！我們從未聽說東境有翼蜥出沒。」
’This is the stupidest thing we’ve heard in a long time, boy. First, the woman clearly wanted you to take a hint, I mean killing a Dragon for her love, come on. Clearly you were meant to just, you know, leave her alone. And second, your plan is really flimsy, at best! We’ve not heard of Basilisks in the Easterlands at all, actually.’

The night's peace is disturbed by the sudden wailing of a creature. 

一具腐爛的屍體坐在村內最高的建築物頂上，絕望地嘀咕著什麼名字。
A decaying corpse sits atop of the town's tallest building, croaking names in despair. 

村裡的一個孩子認出了這個生物，整晚哭號著「媽媽」，直到第二天早上衰弱而死！
A child from your village recognises the creature and cries: 'Mama' for the rest of the eerie night, until its little spirit leaves its body in the morning!

你突然記起來那個孩子的媽媽去年失蹤一直未回。
You remember that the child's mother went missing last year and never returned.

第二天晚上這東西又回到村莊，戰士試圖擊落這活屍，但它以非人的速度閃避了射擊，然後逃跑了！
When the creature returns the next night, fighters attempt to shoot down the corpse, but it evades the shots with inhuman speed, and then it runs away!

Your wise ones heard stories of these poor creatures, Viescy they are called and their design is one of lost love and despair.

不幸的母親，她的屍體現在正入侵你的村莊。她可能出生時就長齊了牙齒，從而招致了現在的命運。
The unfortunate mother whose corpse now invades your village, was likely born with a full set of teeth, thus dooming her young soul to this eventual fate.

無論她最終是如何死去的，她的身體都已經扭曲成了不死的皮囊，現在她在尋求她的親眷，呼喚所有她的親人在死後陪伴她！
Whatever death she met while out in the world, her body twisted into this unliving abomination, and it now seeks out her kin and calls for all her loved ones to join her in the afterlife!

那些關係密切的人，或者過於弱小的人，將會在聽到活屍的哭泣時滅亡！
Those who share a really strong bond, or simply those who are too weak, will perish upon hearing the Viescy's cries!

<STORY>你感覺到屍體和你自己之間有一股強大的神秘連接。你現在想起來，這個大鬍子的女人是卡莎，一年前失蹤的勇敢的斥候。
You sense a strong mystical connection between the corpse and yourselves. This bearded woman, you now remember, was Kasia, a brave scout who went missing over a year ago. 

她的靈魂，像許多其他人一樣，沒有得到安息。由於某種原因，她現在困擾你的村莊。
Her soul, like so many others, lies restless, and for some reason, she now haunts your village.

你知道一種儀式，可以切斷這種聯繫，並有希望將卡莎從這種命運中解放。但是，為了執行儀式，你要帶走屍體，然後尋找一個充滿力量的地方用於進行儀式。
You know a ritual that can sever this bond, and hopefully release Kasia from this fate. But in order to perform this ritual, you'll need to take the body, then seek out a place of power where the rite can be carried out.
<ANS>好吧，去尋找力量之地。
Alright, go and seek the place of power.

No, just burn this body and any others that lie here, and be done with it!

You examine the gravesite and the body, and you recognise that the corpse is actually that of Kasia, one of your scouts gone missing a year ago. 

無盡黑暗已經使得很多人死亡或失蹤，你很難確定她身上發生了什麼，或者為什麼她現在困擾你的村莊。
So many people died and disappeared during the long Darkness, it is hard to pin down what could have happened to her, or why she now haunts your village.

You burn the remains and as the flames devour the body, it crackles and hisses like a poisonous snake! 

透過火焰，你看到一個靈魂發出無聲的尖叫。它的臉，勇敢的卡莎的面容，在痛苦中扭曲！
You see a spirit in the flames, it screams a silent scream and its face, that of the brave Kasia, twists and contorts in pain! 

你聽到遠處無數的哭聲，好像在回應卡莎……
You hear some distant cries of many voices, as if in answer to this one's pain...

你不確定會發生什麼，但肯定不會有屍體再騷擾村莊了！
You are not entirely sure what effect this had, but there certainly is no body to haunt your village now!

當你搜索墓地其他地方時，你發現一些有用的資源，還有一副刻在石頭上的奇怪地圖。
When you search the remainder of the gravesite, you discover some useful resources, but also a strange map, drawn on the side of a stone.

Your wise ones remember now, that in order to banish such a spirit and cease its evil designs towards its loved ones, you must seek out the place where the body is buried and then destroy the clothes that it died in!

畢竟，即使是活屍，也不希望被他們的神注視著，赤裸裸地漫遊大地！
After all, even unliving corpses do not wish to roam the lands naked in the eyes of their Gods!

至少古老的傳說如此……
Or so the old tales say...

智者告訴你，屍體必須被埋在附近，而在此之前需要舉行儀式以尋找它現在的位置。
Your wise ones tell you the corpse must be buried close by and devise a ritual to help track its resting place.
<ANS>好，舉行儀式，找到屍體的安息之所！
Right, so follow the ritual and find the corpse’s grave!

The Kupala Night was once celebrated only once per year, when the sun's power was the closest to Thea. But during the Darkness, the special night was celebrated as soon as the mystical signs were read by the village elders.

The Night of Kupala has many faces and traditions that need to be upheld: bonfires are lit with sticks and stones and placed on hillsides, or other high places around the settlement; offerings of food and animal stock are made in honour of the many Gods; music, dance and laughter accompany the night's rituals!  

但仲夏之夜最重要的儀式都需要由村中的長者來決定。
But the main event is chosen by the village elders with each Solstice.

<STORY>漫長黑夜之中，長者們也無從得知何時是仲夏。數十年間，神聖的庫帕拉之夜都被遺忘。但後來，一些年老的神秘主義者解讀了太陽的信息——有那麼一個短暫的瞬間，陽光以其獨特的力量借由皓月與繁星的反射刺穿黑暗。
During the Long Night of Darkness, there was no way for the elders to tell when the solstice was coming, and within a few decades, the sacred Night of Kupala was all but abandoned. But then, some old mystics read the solar signs - brief moments where the power of sunlight, or the force of the moon and stars, shone through the dark veil with particular strength. 

自此之後，庫帕拉之夜可以在一年之中舉辦多次，但都必須在神秘主義者探知到了強大的太陽能量時才行。
Since then, Kupala Night can be celebrated more than once in a year, but always when a great solar event is anticipated by the Mystics.

如果蠟燭引燃了花環或是它沉入了河中，那麼它的製作者今年將無法得到愛情。但如果它在火焰中倖存下來並順著水流漂向遠方，那麼一段浪漫的愛情即將降臨！
If the candle burns the wreath, or if it sinks in the river, its maker will not find love this year. But if it survives the flames and swims with the currents, it's a clear sign of love to come!

年輕人通過愛與友誼結成兩人小組，他們將手持太陽神的雕像並一起跨越火焰。
In pairs, chosen by the bonds of love and fellowship, two youths will jump through the fires, holding a carved figurine of the Sun God in their hands.

如果他們和雕像都完好無損地跨越了火焰，那麼證明他們之間確實存在強烈的羈絆，兩人的能力都會得到提升。但是，如果雕像被燒燬或是兩人之中的任何一個被火焰燙傷，他們之間的羈絆就是虛偽的，而這虛偽將被視為是對眾神的侮辱！
If they emerge unharmed and with the figurine intact, their bond will prove true and their strength will be rewarded. If, however, the figurine should burn, or the pair be hurt by the flames, their bond is untrue, and so their false trial an affront to the Gods!

'Well done, my knights! You have passed the test of loyalty and purity of soul, for this sword is known to lead its keepers astray.

當你們站在那兒，沐浴在這神奇的感覺中時，一個女人從湖中出現，口吻平靜而威嚴：
As you stand there, basking in the new feeling, a woman appears out of the lake and speaks in a calm, yet commanding voice:

「歡迎，阿拉索的騎士們。你們從卡梅洛斯遠道而來，而我，湖中女神，將會按照約定，賜予你們騎士的祝福。」
'Welcome, Knights of Arathorn. You are far from Camroth, yet I, the Lady of the Lake, will grant your knightly boon, as it was agreed.'
<ANS>「謝謝你，湖中女神。」

<STORY>女神幾乎沒有看向你們，只是點了點頭。她給了你們一個相當大的箱子，吟誦道：
The Lady barely looks at you and only nods. She hands you a sizable chest and recites:

「我在此完成我對卡梅洛斯的阿拉索王座下騎士的誓約。願這些物品引領你們走在啟蒙與完成王國使命的道路上。願君珍重！」
'I hereby fulfill my oath to the Knights of King Arathor from Camroth. May these offerings guide you on your path to enlightenment and your quest for our kingdom. Fare thee well!'

你們持有的一件武器被賦予了魔法，現在它可以吸取敵人的生命！女神將箱子留在岸上，然後和湖一起消失了！
One of your weapons becomes touched with magic and is now capable of siphoning life from the enemy! The woman leaves the chest for you on the shore and then disappears along with the lake!

<STORY>女神看著你們，就好像初次見面一般。她微微側頭，說：
The Lady looks at you as if seeing you for the first time. She tilts her head and speaks again:

「有趣——你們並不是我在等待的騎士。你們確實帶著阿拉索的標記，但那非常模糊，幾乎無法注意到。
'Interesting — you are not the knights I was waiting for. You do carry the mark of Arathorn, but it is faint, barely noticeable. 

是我們年輕的國王偏離了他正義的道路，以至於他將我的恩惠給了衣衫襤褸的陌生人？
Has our young King strayed from his righteous path that he gives out my favour to raggedy strangers? 

不過，你通過了試煉，因此我不會收回祝福，並且我還將賜予你們一件小禮物。但別再嘗試召喚我了，除非你們成為了真正的卡梅洛斯的騎士！」
Still, you have passed the test, so I will not take away my blessing, and I will even grant you this small gift. But do not ever presume to call upon me again unless you become true Knights of Camroth!'

湖中女神給了你們一個小箱子，然後和整個湖一起消失了！
The Lady hands you a small chest and then disappears along with the whole lake!

'You dare to enter my domain, in the company of Grahruth, a disgraced nobody, and then raise your voice at me?'

'Eh, this is Dwarf business, but I can tell you a wee bit of it. You see, my chamber here, well, I won't tell you what it is, exactly, suffice to say it is part of our greater kingdom. But as we did not wish to abandon you surface dwellers completely, these outposts serve as a waypoint. In short, I did not abandon my duties. I heard the call of our leaders and I joined our kin in the depths of the earth so the Darkness cannot reach us.

但那些沒能聽從命令的——有些人過於弱小，沒來得及，或者由於太過分心而沒能及時聽到召喚，又或者更糟，他們選擇留在地表——他們使自己蒙羞。
But those who failed to adhere to the order — those who were too weak to make it in time, or too distracted to even know when they are called, or worse yet, those who chose to stay with your kind — they shamed themselves.

我不會說的更詳細了；我已經盡我所能向外來者解釋這個。」
I will not go into more detail; I have explained this the best I can to an outsider.'
<ANS>「謝謝。我們不會質疑你們的傳統，但我們的朋友早已多次證明他的榮耀。」
'Thank you, we will not question your customs. But we will say that our friend has proven his honour many times.'

There were three types: Vielkolud and Wildwives, which were the two most common types, and Planetnik, the cloud Giants and the guardians of the other two. 

巨人被強迫沉眠，只有在風之巨人的守護下，才可以小群小群地交替甦醒。但黑暗擾亂了這些。
The Giants were put to sleep, and they should wake only in small groups under the care of the Planetniks, but the Darkness disrupted this.

現在，還出現了不死巨人，雖然身死但被肉體所束縛；還有影之巨人，被稱為摩羅基——邪惡、嗜血、為黑暗服務！
Now, there are also the Unliving Giants, those who died but are trapped in their bodies, and the Shadow Giants, called Mroki - evil, bloodthirsty and serving the Darkness!

不管沉眠中發生了什麼，摩羅基已經腐化了這自然循環。如果沒人阻止他們的首領，他的力量將再次遮蔽太陽！
Whatever happened during the sleep, the Mroki have corrupted the natural cycle. If their leader is not stopped, his power can cover the sun once more!

你看，並不是說他很邪惡——那太單純了。只是在他睡眠的時候，黑暗入侵了他的心臟。而現在，他腐臭的力量正渴望撕裂世界，而非建造世界。
You see, it is not that he is evil — that would be too simple. It is just that during his sleep, the Darkness weaved its way into his very heart and now, his power of the humming, instead of building the world, seeks to take it apart.

‘The Planetnik have two skills. One is to collect clouds into their enormous sacks so the Giants have more sun. The second is to change those clouds into sleeping clouds that can put Giants into their slumber. While the other Giants sleep, the Planetnik sit high up in the clouds and become one with the skies until they are needed again.’

’So why are the Giants awake?’

<PHASE>ID: 34
<STORY>「我不知道到底發生了什麼。我只知道黑暗腐化了巨人的沉眠。黑暗入侵了他們的夢，並借此影響他們的哼唱！
‘I do not know what happened for certain. I only know that the Darkness corrupted the Giants’ sleep. It weaved its way into their dreams and thus infected the hum of the builders itself!

現在，不僅所有巨人同時甦醒，而且還不記得他們的目的。更糟糕的是，有些巨人扭曲變成了墮落的魔鬼，摩羅基，或稱之為不死巨人！他們在黑暗中行走，就好像黑暗是他們的一部分。而他們的首領，憤怒之主，每經過一個夜晚都會變得更強。」
Now, not only are all of the Giants waking at once, but they do not remember why, or what their purpose is. Worse yet, some have been twisted into corrupted fiends, the Mroki, or the Unliving Corpses! They seem to walk the Darkness as if it was a part of them, and their leader, the Umbrage Lord, grows stronger with every passing night.’

'Eh, this is Dwarf business, but I can tell you a wee bit of it. You see, my chamber here, well, I won't tell you what it is, exactly, suffice to say it is part of our greater kingdom. But as we did not wish to abandon you surface dwellers completely, these outposts serve as a waypoint. In short, I did not abandon my duties. I heard the call of our leaders and I joined our kin in the depths of the earth so the Darkness cannot reach us.

但那些沒能聽從命令的——有些人過於弱小，沒來得及，或者由於太過分心而沒能及時聽到召喚，又或者更糟，他們選擇留在地表——他們使自己蒙羞。
But those who failed to adhere to the order — those who were too weak to make it in time, or too distracted to even know when they are called, or worse yet, those who chose to stay with your kind — they shamed themselves.

我言盡於此；我已經盡我所能向外來者作出解釋。」

Now, there are also the Unliving Giants, those who died but are trapped in their bodies, neither dead nor alive, and the Shadow Giants, called Mroki — shadow fiends, akin to Darkness itself.

黑暗遊走於生死之間，觸及了巨人的首領並腐化了它。如果沒人阻止首領，他的力量將再次遮蔽太陽！
The Darkness travels between the living and the dead, and it reached the Giants’ sleep and corrupted it. If their leader is not stopped, his power can cover the sun once more!

‘I sought to trap you with my song, but I will leave revenge to my masters — those who now awaken and will trample your feeble towns. You once left me for dead, so I now wish your lives cursed!'

她消失了，但似乎什麼都沒有發生。
She disappears, but nothing more happens.

You cannot speak a word out of fear that you might break the wonder that surrounds you. Then you see a figure made of wind float towards you, her face angry, yet beautiful. 

你被她的美貌所惑，愣在原地，此時你聽到：
Entranced by her beauty, you wait, and you hear:

「你曾經棄我於荒野不顧，我願你的身體在痛苦中掙扎！雲之主回歸了，他們將會踐踏你們！」
'As you once abandoned me to the wild, may your bodies twist and turn in pain and agony! The masters of the clouds return, and they shall trample you!'

你感到一個詛咒降臨到了你們所有人身上！
You feel a curse befall you all!

「殺了這些賤民！獻上他們的首級！」
'Attack the peasants! Bring me their heads!'
